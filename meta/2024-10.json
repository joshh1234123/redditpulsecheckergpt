I am running a DV360 YouTube auction campaign (VRC with only YouTube selected as inventory) at around $20-30k monthly. \n\nI’ve pulled placement reports and am noticing we are clearing on YouTube TV inventory (networks) that aligns really well with what we are buying on the Linear TV, but only a small portion of the budget maybe $1k a month. I assume it’s just luck of the draw if YT TV has an inventory spot to fill they pull from live VRC campaigns.\n\nQuestion: My client is obviously interested in seeing how to push more of our VRC buy to YT TV because the CPMs are comparable to linear $2-4 but they only way to buy YT TV is through instant reserve deals which have us quoted around $25 for a YT TV select RON and my client hyper focuses on CPMs so that’s a no go for him.\n\nHas anyone had success with rigging a VRC to favor YT TV inventory in the auction?

This delay seems excessive, and I’m curious how it affects your operations:\n\n1. **How significant is this delay**? Does the lack of immediate revenue create cash flow issues, especially before you establish a steady stream of income?\n2. **After the initial 120-day period**, when revenue becomes more predictable, does this delay still impact your business, or is it less of a concern?\n3. If quicker payment options existed (even at a slight discount), would this be something you’d consider to improve liquidity?\n\n**Edit:** Realised I didn’t explain the quick payment angle properly - sorry for any confusion. So let’s say there are investors willing to take on some risk. Think of a setup where a group of investors steps in, buys up ad inventory for a set period (say, 6 months), and pays the publisher upfront (obv only doing it if there’s money to be made). For those 6 months, the ad impression revenue goes straight to the holders. This way, publishers hedge their revenue stream, dodge the cash flow crunch, and sort out the working capital problem.",

I have a solid understanding of the programmatic ecosystem, including DSPs, SSPs, ad exchanges, and data management platforms.\n\nHowever, I'm always looking to learn more and increase my earning potential. I'm particularly interested in part-time remote positions in the UK or US that could supplement my income.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on:\n\n - Advanced Programmatic Techniques: Are there any specific skills or certifications that could help me command higher salaries? I'm only familiar with GMP and my expertise lies mostly with DV360. \n\n - Freelancing Opportunities: How can I effectively market myself as a freelance programmatic expert? I know getting DV360 access may only be possible via agencies or connecting with partners-- But how do I get in touch with them? And also if the situation could be different with other DSPs? \n\n - Remote Job Boards or Networks: Where should I focus my job search for high-paying remote roles?\n\nI'm really disappointed with how much I make and the impact I have on organisations so any insights or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

      "content": "Hello Programmatic Community!  Need your Collective Wisdom and Advice!\n\nI work for Spectrum Reach, the advertising sales division of Charter Communications.  We use 1st party data from our access as the internet service provider to 30 million homes + 3rd party data (70+ data partners) to find, reach, and measure audiences across linear television viewing on cable networks as well as streaming TV viewing across linear/CTV/Mobile/Tablet.  \n  \nAs a local market sales manager, i'm primarily selling/running managed service campaigns through direct insertion orders.  In the last couple years i've seen a growing number of clients/ad agencies becoming savvier with their buying approaches, setting up seats at DSPs like MNTN, TTD, StackAdapt, Basis, etc.\n\nWith Linear Pay TV subs & linear TV budgets in decline, along with the continued shift into CTV budgets + programmatic approach on the rise, I've started to consider if it's a good time to make a career switch into working for a DSP to become more well rounded for what the next 5-10 years in the industry will look like.\n\nWould love to get advice/input from this community on things like: \n\n \\- what DSP would be best to transition into from a \"legacy\" media like linear pay TV media sales?   \n \\- Am I crazy to think I could add value to a DSP sales organization with my background?    \n \\- If not, what aspects of coming from a company like Spectrum Reach could i leverage?  \n \\- What roles would make for the best transition?  Assuming sales as that's my current role but perhaps I'm missing something about needing to start with a different role for the transition?  \n",

While, I do think this is correct, but my concern was on ad collision and exhaustion. Hence, my recommendation was to set frequency cap and monitor the “frequency limited” impression lost chart and optimize accordingly.\n\nEspecially considering the fact that my client is selling home appliances which the product prices are not that cheap. Thinking from the user’s perspective, I would find it annoying to have to see multiple ads at the same time. \n\nAdditionally, we run the campaigns globally which consists of countries with huge audience pool and inventories like India and Indonesia.\n\nCould you let me know which option would be better?\n\nDo let me know if you require more info!",
