Budgets are also organized more easily so we're not accidentally spending budgets from the previous year. Are there any other reasons to duplicate campaigns for the new year?

The content currently lives on YouTube and on their web platform via dedicated video player and we are looking to maximize the library via CTV. It’s really solid output, it’s entirely owned by the publisher, and is targeting a sought after audience. It can also easily be reconfigured/packaged (so to speak) to live in a CTV space.\n\nWith that, I’m keen to know - from a publisher standpoirnt - where does one start when it comes to seeding their content onto CTV?\n\nAre there any leading networks/agencies that one could / should approach to place their content on?\n\nDo such platforms exist or is it a case of building one’s own channel and plugging in adverting ala display? \n\nAdmittedly a bit of a novice on the topic, but from what I’ve seen there’s the options of launching one’s own channel and the option placing content on an existing network’s channel. Given the newness of the venture and lack of assurances of scalability, the latter is definitely preferred. \n\nVery nearly onboarded onto one of the networks we work with who were, themselves, veering into the CTV space. But the contract was quite rigid and restrictive and, in being a new platform in and of itself, didn’t come with much assurance of revenue.\n\nI guess, in essence, the primary ask is: who are the key players in the space when it comes to taking on premium content and ensuring it delivers solid revenue for the publisher. \n\nThe goal, in all transparency, is to have their video library work “for” them. Both from an incremental revenue standpoint and from the standpoint of display being so unpredictable that there’s a need more than ever to diversity revenue streams.\n\nAny insights / assistance would be greatly appreciated.",

      "content": "I see a lot of questions here about whitelisting and blacklisting.\n\nAlso, I think that quality is one of the biggest concerns in our industry. I've audited tons of different campaigns and inventory was (almost) always a case - traders target 20+ SSP, resellers, web+app, don't use allowlists etc. This all leads to significant budgets spent on MFAs, long tail sites, and ultimately, lower campaign performance and issues with brand safety\n\n\\*I have a detailed guide about Inventory optimization (Blacklisting and whitelisting) as well as a checklist - here is the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MAaEtXirpUs5uHGetFGYTkWmRD1-4weW/view?usp=sharing) (guide), [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TbOAyL9U0Cxfx97_iylUALQHiI8BcISlOzzQ4wmruow/edit?usp=sharing) (checklist)\n\nBut if you want to fix it quickly, there are two ways:\n\n1. Blacklist - low level of effort, but also low effectiveness. New MFA sites emerge daily, so you can't catch them all in real-time;\n\n2. Whitelist - a higher level of effort - but effectiveness is significantly higher. I recommend using your existing data (app/url or site report) and making a standard URL analysis. Identify strict rules (aka filters) based on your KPI (i.e, CPA) and eliminate long-tail websites (there can be 60,000+ sites, which doesn't make sense); eliminate sites with 0 conversions; eliminate sites with higher than average CPA. Here we go - you got a list of websites that drove you conversions with affordable CPA. It will be the basis of your allowlist. Now, you need to verify them - and remove low-quality and MFA sites (yes, that can 'drive' conversions, by just attributing last touch) - I recommend you check traffic sources of those sites (i.e if organic traffic is low this is a bad sign), also check number ads on the webpage, ads.txt and etc. After all of that - congrats, you can apply it to your campaigns\n\nBut if you want to be 100% sure in your inventory - you need to do a proper supply path optimization and do the same with your supply vendors (SSPs).\n\n",

The pub has confirmed they are sending heaps of impressions to us, we don't have a lot of targeting on(geo, small amount of brand safety) but we still seem to be having trouble. Is it because we are on autobid? The deals are PMPs(floor price) and we have \"dont exceed average CPM\" on which is higher than the floor prices. To test, we removed those favoured deals to force the algo to spend on the other PMPs but that has stopped the whole insertion order altogether instead of forcing the other PMPs to spend.

However, I’m curious if the same can be done with eCommerce data. Specifically:\n\n1. Is it possible to link eCommerce data (e.g., online purchases, user behavior) to DV360?\n2. Are there native tools or integrations available, or would it require a custom solution?\n3. Has anyone successfully used eCommerce audience segments (e.g., purchase history, preferences) to improve targeting and ROI in DV360 campaigns?\n\nI’d love to hear about your experiences, tools, or any best practices you can share. Thanks in advance! 🚀",
