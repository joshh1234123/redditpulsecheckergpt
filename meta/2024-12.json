It would be a unique advantage for a buying team to have someone else join their team who has been working closely with buyers on supply side. The bidding strategy comes with practice, sure, but it’s important to have experience within different parts of the ecosystem rather than a singular, traditional buying background. Planning is a huge part of the success of buyers. The granular nature of some of these job qualifications in ad tech are giving me a headache.

In OTT, I’ve focused primarily on lead generation across verticals like insurance, fintech, banking, and e-commerce. Lead generation has been straightforward for me with a rinse-and-repeat strategy, but e-commerce campaigns are a different story.\n\nI’ve tried adapting my lead generation strategies to e-commerce purchases, but they don’t seem to gain traction.

Also considering Geopath is the official attribution service for dOOH so need to connect the missing link here before I meet them tomorrow ",

Very insightful and creative stuff.\n\nHowever, I need to get out of the net new sales path. My 20s have been spent sending calls and emails into cyberspace and I’m officially over it.\n\nWhat are some fun paths to take in this space that aren’t just net new sales? I don’t mind being client facing — just need to escape the meaningless cold call life.\n\nI have Vistar DOOH certs, Google Ads Suite cert, AMC Foundations, and 8 or 9 Trade Desk certs. I’m raw but am committed to self development. \n\nTYIA!",

Is this something you can predict or does it feel random? any tips on how to manage these ups and downs?\n\nWhen it comes to managing working capital, how do publishers handle it in case ad revenues swing? ",

Recently, I completed The TradeDesks Kokai UI training and the videos were more high level, explanations of the AI co-pilot, not a lot of hands on training in the platform, or specifics in regards to optimizations to look for daily. I suppose I am looking for quick tips and tricks, that sort of thing. Has anyone stumbled onto better training videos somewhere? I feel like I am just floating my accounts and going through the motions... I want to know how to increase their success and GROW my clients business. Any advice would be lovely!
