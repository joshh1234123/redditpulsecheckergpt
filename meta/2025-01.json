Not sure if this falls directly into programmatic, but our agency has our programmatic department cover all media outside of search and social, including host read podcast ads.\n\nI am looking for your experience or recommendations for measurement vendors/platforms that allow our brand to measure cross device effectiveness across multiple ad networks for host read ads (DAI). I understand that most vendors ID graph solution is modeled or deterministic given the limitations of host read tracking but want to hear what’s worked for your brands\n\nWhen we have worked with SXM in the past they let us measure via Claritas and I liked the data but the UI and reporting was a bit lackluster. We want to broaden our list of preferred partners/vendors to help our brands get the best value depending on how diverse their HR activations are. \n\nFor more context our agency mainly leverages CM360 for aggregated ad server measurement across DSPs and direct activations, but they currently do not have solutions catered for host read. Some of our brands also use MMM tools but those vary (Measured, NorthBeam, etc)\n\nUltimately just want to have additional data that is agnostic from the owned and operated ad networks to verify if their shows are performing well without bias. \n\nThank you, and happy new year!

I'll be starting with 2 to 6 screens and hope to grow.\n\nI plan to approach local businesses myself to start, with the intent to grow the network large enough to go programmatic. \n\nI'm open to any advice or insight that you all may have. My two questions to start:\n\n1. Are there SSPs that are more willing to work with smaller and new media networks?  \n2. Is there a known magic number of screens (or of CPM) that SSPs expect to work with them?\n\nThanks so much!",

      "content": "For context: my current role is not within programmatic directly; I work at an agency within the digital investment group, so I allocate funds across social, CTV, OLV, display etc. and would work with our programmatic team to place those buys. From my vantage point, I'm having trouble justifying why I (or anyone) would buy online video on the open web for a few reasons:\n\n1. Quality: it seems like the vast majority of inventory is low quality - small player size, outstream (not inherently bad but arguably worse than instream), sound off, and/or delivered on sites with tons of ads\n   * Is there any way to understand or control delivery based on the number of ads on a page within a DSP or other tools? If so, what are they?\n2. User Expectation/Experience: maybe its just me but i can't remember the last time I watched a video on a publisher site; if i'm on web it's to read. I go elsewhere for video. I could see sports maybe being the exception to this, but tell me if my perception is off here.\n\nUltimately there are just so many other places I would spend video dollars first (YouTube, CTV, etc) that I am wondering how you make the case for open web. Or are you strictly tapping into specific suppliers or PMP/PG for quality video?\n\nA separate but related note is that I feel like my agency's programmatic team sucks. They default every buy to open web and do nothing to improve quality or curate differentiated supply. They resist anything that would a) make more work for them or b) cause an increase in CPMs - even with clients directly asking for instream only OLV and being comfortable with double the cost; but I digress.",

For example, if I have a VTR (View-Through Rate) goal of 70%, I exclude all sites performing below that threshold.\n\nI'm interested in hearing how I could expand this strategy. Are there other techniques you use that might help, especially in cases where the list of sites I need to deliver on is limited? Any insights on how to further refine or complement this approach would be greatly appreciated.\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts!\n\nThanks!",
