I've been trying to find a solution for so long.. but nobody could help.\n\nI am hosting Rich-media creative (300x600) with video inside on my server. I want to run a campaign in DV360 by entering Third Party Ad Tag. For this, I use iFrame code : <iframe src=\"serverlink\" style=\"width:300px;height:600px;margin:0;padding:0;border:none;overflow:hidden;box-sizing:border-box;\"></iframe>\n\nDv360 normally preview creative. When I run this ad, I see views, but 0 clicks. I know the problem is connected with lack of DV360 click macros. How and where i need to put Dv360 click macro? In iFrame code or in hosted creative? Maybe i should add kind of click layer?\n\nI would be very thankful for any thoughts :)",

All in a **streamlined solution that is free-to-use**!\n\nWould you find this platform useful? I’d love to hear your feedback! What’s the best way to get pros like you to try it out? If you’ve used similar platforms before, what made you stay (or switch)? Also, if you're interested in **early access**, drop a comment or DM me – would love to chat. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! \n\n🚀Available second half of February",

That’s why I decided to build **Programmatic Pilot** – a flexible, **on-demand service where agencies can get expert programmatic execution without long-term hires.**\n\nThe idea is simple: agencies **only pay for what they need**, whether it’s **campaign setups, optimizations, reporting, or troubleshooting.** Instead of hiring full-time or relying on inconsistent freelancers, [https://programmaticpilot.com](https://programmaticpilot.com) takes care of execution efficiently and on demand.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts on this approach—do you think this is something agencies would find valuable?

I understand AI and algorithms take time to adjust, but most of the time, I end up pausing the campaign.\n\n**Here are my observations and questions:**\n\n1. If I set a daily budget of $100 and get a sale, I often raise the budget by $50, hoping the ad that converted will continue performing. But instead, the campaign breaks. Would it be better to wait until the campaign consistently spends its budget and generates daily conversions before increasing it?\n2. Sometimes, my campaign doesn’t fully spend its daily budget (e.g., $70 out of $100) but still converts. Is it logical to increase the budget if it’s not even fully utilizing the current one? Would raising CPC be a better approach?\n3. I’ve noticed that when a product performs well (getting multiple daily sales from one strong ad and consistently spending its budget), increasing the budget by $50-$100 doesn’t break the campaign—instead, it improves performance.\n\nI’m feeling a bit lost, especially with small products that are harder to scale in general. Are there any courses, books, or seminars you’d recommend to better understand budget optimization in DSPs and CPC? I would love to hear your advice and experience on this.\n\nThanks a lot!",

And yes I know it's crazy that after this long I don't know when I should be an expert already! \n\nThe issue is that in the first 1y5 of my career in Prog was just doing reporting because the AdOps people in my small agency would do the trafficking, set up campaigns and optimise, so as a campaign manager, I was just doing weekly reports and PCAs. \n\nI have now joined another agency where I'm supposed to do proper end-to-end campaign management but unfortunately I didn't spend much time working with DV360 and CM360 because my clients decided to solely do ABM campaigns and use managed service.\n\nThis is really frustrating because I'm a bit more senior but sometimes I feel I don't know the basics. I'm back managing campaigns on DV360, so I need to learn how to do optimisations and I have done lots of research but I I'm not finding good optimisations strategies specifically for Display, video or native ads on DV360 and when I find articles about optimisations, it's very generic.\n\nAll I wanted to know is specific steps I can take when KPIs/metrics such as impressions, clicks, spend, conversions, video views, CTR, CPC, CPM and VCR are either too low or too high.\n\nI managed to compile a bit of information on this. For example, I know I can look at changing the frequency cap, budget cap, pacing settings and viewability if the campaign is over pacing or under pacing. I did check of the Google Support articles for DV360 but they're not very specific. They only have articles on \"Optimized targeting\" and \"Optimize your YouTube campaign\". I also can't seem to find any YT videos teaching how to optimise programmatic campaigns. \n\nIt's so frustrating because my senior managers don't have time to train me and honestly I feel a bit embarrassed not knowing after a year in the company but they didn't even teach me when I first start. And trying to learn at home is challenging when resources are so scattered all over the Internet.\n\nSorry for the rant but does anyone has tips on how to optimise campaigns? I would really appreciate if someone could do a little breakdown. Thank you!\n\n",

      "content": "TTD got shellacked today from earnings yesterday. The call itself sounded like the ramblings of someone who has no idea what is going on. Constantly repetition, selling Wall Street on scrum counts, praying DV360 gets spun off and saves their growth for another year. \n\nWell today it looks like Wall St heard all that and said fuck this mess, we’re dumping our money into AppLovin. They see AppLovin as the next Facebook because AppLovin has focused on performance advertising for mobile apps and is allegedly going to open that up to SMBs. I’m skeptical that they can pull that off, I don’t see SMBs trusting a random ad tech company that sounds like it’s name is a bad play on a Judd Apatow joke, but Wall St is gonna fuck that chicken for a bit and they bought more time with it today. \n\nTTD down 30% APP up 24% in the same day. APP is worth 4x TTD today. \n\nSo the future of Wall St investment in ad tech is performance. Well programmatic can’t compete with FB and Search on that front. They don’t own any inventory. Strength for neutrality but a kick in the balls for economics and performance media math. \n\nSo what’s a tech company to do to make the street happy? Time to get into the oil business. \n\nEssentially TTD is a refiner: they don’t own the mineral rights, but a lot of folks that do will send their oil to TTD for processing. Problem is the pipelines they have in place are hitting capacity. Sure you can shift some oil going to another refinery over to your (DV360 losing Google benefits) but that doesn’t change the total oil you have access to. \n\nAnd looking at the last year, Wall St loves to hear the refinery tapped into more oil pipelines. \n\nIn May of last year, TTD got a nice boost in their share price from one simple announcement: Netflix. An app with minimal supply and supply that TTD was sharing with DV360 made a nearly 15% bump in a matter of days. \n\nJeff talks about the TAM for TTD being $1T. Well sorry man, but no that is not your TAM. That $1T includes linear, Social, and Search/YouTube which you can’t touch. In fact those are the majority of that TAM. 20% of it is Meta and YouTube alone, of which YouTube is $30B a year globally. $30B. As in almost 3x what TTDs total global spend is. \n\nNetflix inventory? Maybe $50M. It’s a wild guess. But that tiny rounding error to the Global advertising industry is worth 15% to the stock price. How much would an untapped $30B market be?????? \n\nNow I know what everyone’s saying and yes, it’s almost impossible. Except for one gap in the Google Armor: Influencers. \n\nYouTube isn’t produced by Google, it’s a distribution and auction platform. No one wants to go compete with them on the distribution front, granted, but that latter front is an unchallenged market. As in the same kind of unchallenged market digital media was when programmatic kicked off its journey over a decade ago. \n\nYou’ll never lobby Google to open up the inventory, but influencers could have standing to sue Google into having to do so. Influencers are being ripped off by Google every day that goes by. Every impression on YouTube is essentially valued the same in their auction logic. A YouTube channel with pubescent teens making farts noises is getting the same auction value as a fully produced piece of content from another channel that took months to create. Why? Because Google has tried to artificially keep CPMs in YT low to keep the dollars flowing for their growth targets. They keep opening up more and more inventory every year to more and more channels and more and more formats. So YouTubers are making most of their money off of the platform by custom sponsorships and selling merch. \n\nBut what if the channels making the best content could actually be valued higher than the channels making dick all content? Why can’t that happen now? Because YouTube is as much a monopoly against the influencers as it is against the advertisers. \n\nSo you could goad the influencers to start taking legal action to force the issue on their behalf but that is like herding cats. \n\nOr you could centralize your efforts in one push: Spotter Media. \n\nThose guys have paid a boat load of investor money ($1B) buying the future rights to YouTube channel content. They say they have a solid business model, but color me skeptical. Maybe they are the JG Wentworth of influencers, but there’s no chance in hell JG Wentworth would pass on the change to increase the interest rates of the annuities they bought upfront. They have a lot of hold on a lot of content, and they stand to return a lot more money to their investors and themselves if they can increase the CPMs that content is generating. \n\nSo go drink that milkshake Daniel Plainview. Figure out which straw you want to use, but start drilling now. Even if you tap a 1/3 of the inventory in YouTube, you’ve potentially doubled your global revenue in one year. The ad format is the same, it’s the largest CTV app there is, and you save this stock growth for another 5 years at least. ",

The Trade Desk has set a Q1 2025 revenue guidance of at least $575 million, projecting a 17% year-over-year growth.\n\nCEO Jeff Green attributed the revenue shortfall to \"execution missteps,\" not market conditions.

Prog Open Market seems to always do much better in driving revenue comparable to PMP/PG side so I'm not sure if the market seems to just prefer that route over a direct connection to our inventory via deals or a change in the market I'm not aware of, but it's demoralizing to see that side do so well yet I'm not pulling my weight when I've done so much to try and improve my side of the PG/PMP patch. I've created a programmatic deck, building relationships with clients, outlining our key USP that makes us unique compared to other publishers, diving through SSPs to locate advertisers spending via OM and contacting on LinkedIn, just to name a few.\n\nI'd love to hear from buyers/planners or anyone relevant on what would make you interested in what we have to offer you or helps us to stand out.

      "content": "Hey everyone! I’m going to share my thoughts below, and I’m hoping to get some opinions. \n\nWhen creating reports (daily, weekly, post campaign, etc.) to send to a client, I believe there are two main ways to aggregate the data by day. \n\nOption 1: Aggregate by Conversion Date (timestamp of the pixel fire)\n\nOption 2: Aggregate by Impression Date (timestamp(s) of the impression(s) that the conversion is attributed to)\n\nI can see both of these being useful for different cases. \n\nConversion Date is great for the “big picture”, can be insightful for clients to better understand their customers. They can see the days of week, times of day, and date ranges where the bulk of conversions occur. This is can be insightful, but mainly for purchases and other very low-funnel actions. Conversion date/time seems far less insightful for a site visit pixel. I can see this being valuable for a campaign manager/trader as well. You can heavy up during the “high conversion” time periods, trying to steal attribution as close to the conversion as possible. While this is a common tactic, it’s really just for the traders, and something they certainly wouldn’t want to share with their clients… so pretty irrelevant for this conversation. \n\nOn the other hand, Impression Date is great for optimization. If there is a clear trend showing that impressions delivered at “4-7pm on Sunday” drive an extremely low CPA, a trader can optimize on that and share the insight with the client. Or maybe it shows the week leading up to a particular holiday got a ton of attributed conversions, and the client should heavy up their budget there next year. IMO this is more insightful because impressions are controllable. Also, it allows all conversions to be tied to a date within the campaign flight dates. Aggregating on Conversion Date will result in a bunch of conversions falling outside of the campaign range, which can be a lot of it’s a large lookback window like 30 days. The downside to impression date is that the data changes over time. If you send the client a weekly reporting, it will need to be cumulative every time as even the previous weeks will continue to generate conversions until the lookback window closes. \n\nI also want to note that I’m aware conversions can be tied to many different impressions depending on which attribution model is used. But in those cases, they would simply split as they would according to the model. I just referred to it as a singular “impression” for sake of simplicity.\n\nOverall, I think Impression Date is more relevant and appropriate as a standard, and then adjust to conversion date when relevant. Of course, the client may have a preference and that would be the answer. But I’m mainly discussing what the standard could/should be. \n\nWould love to hear thoughts from others on this. Thanks in advance!",

We run brand-building and reach campaigns, where we need the budget to be somewhat evenly split—for example, around 60% on bumpers and 40% on nonskip/longer formats, so that the brand and the message is shown with longer non-skip and you get reminded of the brand with bumpers.\n\nRight now, bumpers are spending like there’s no tomorrow, while longer formats are getting pushed back. The split often ends up around 90-95% on bumpers and only 5-10% on longer formats, which is just not acceptable. Our current workaround is basically a band-aid solution—manually turning off bumpers from time to time. And just to clarify, the issue isn’t a low target CPM.\n\nI've reached out to Google support, and the suggested solution was to split bumpers and nonskip ads into separate line items. However, that doesn’t really work for us. We need both formats to work together—especially in lower-budget campaigns, where frequency could end up being driven entirely by bumpers, which isn’t the goal. The core of our campaigns is longer, nonskip formats.\n\nIs there any elegant way to control the budget split within a single line item?",

My annual pay package is $100k CAD. The campaigns I’m supposed to run were supposed to start from March but have been postponed to May.\n\nI personally feel that I might be in a layoff list if it happens as I’m managing very little spend compared to the pay I’m getting. Also seems very less work for the next month or two which could be a problem when my probation is ending. On the other hand I’m just starting off my third week so I don’t know if it’s too early to highlight this concern I’m having. What would you guys suggest about this?",

I don't have any knowledge or exposure to any platform - be it DV360, TTD, Amazon DSP - nothing.  \nJust doing mere certifications or even shadowing seniors on platform is not going to help.  \nThis seems more like data punching work without any involvement or pratical experience in strategy or platform.\n\nApart from this, I have noticed programmatics roles are only available in agencies (atleast where I stay) and I don't want to work in agencies all my life. Max 3-4 years and then switch to brand side.\n\nWhereas one gets to work with startups and fast growing FMCG brands in paid search and social (as well as agencies)  \nIt's my passion to work in FMCG or D2C and maybe with Google or Meta.\n\nI feel stuck.\n\nSome of my seniors say, programmatics is growing, pays more long term and programmatic specialists are rare, while paid social / search is easily learnable and dime a dozen.\n\nNeed insights on what I should do.",
