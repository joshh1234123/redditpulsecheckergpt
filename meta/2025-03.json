Magnite reports strong growth in CTV demand, and PubMatic's CTV revenue doubled in Q4 2024.\n\n * Amazon is driving down streaming TV ad costs. Ad buyers on Amazon Prime are paying around $40 per thousand viewers.\n\n * AI is changing the game. Amazon is testing video ads in its generative AI-powered shopping tool, Rufus.\n\n * Retail media networks are rebranding themselves as media companies.\n\n * CMOs are under pressure. 69% of CEOs and CFOs would fire a CMO for failure to deliver promised results.\n  \nA complete summary and links to these stories and more (Data minimization in ad tech, alternative ad measurement, connected commerce, X AI ad tool, and IPG principal trading) can be found [here](https://cmotldr.beehiiv.com/p/cmo-tldr-your-weekly-marketing-brief-2282025).\n\nWhat do you think of these stories?",

It was a project we worked on here and there and we finally finished it but we want to figure out a unique offer that would be useful for agencies and brands so they can use it. We were thinking of doing a free white label and offering additional dev services at a low cost to tie in whatever DMPs or other analytics agency clients want to use (we already track a lot of the player activity so that's included) and then coming up with an extremely affrordable SaaS model that would be far cheaper than any kind of rev share or high CPM based fee. This can be used on all devices including CTV. We can even tie in an ad fraud pervention analytics solution as well.  Is anything about this approach potentially useful? I figured if agencies and brands had their own player it could go a long way to eliminate wasted ad spend. I know there are other player options which is why I was thinking the customization piece would help. Thank you all for reading my post!",

What are your opinions on this product ? Is this a good tool to analyze audiences ? I've seen some companies making a business on AMC, and I wanted to know how solid the product is to sustain long term offers from companies. \n\nOn my end, I took an interest on it because of its cookieless/clean-room/Amazon audiences features and have been taking courses on Amazon Academy to better understand it. Maybe propose it to the agency I work ?\n\nThanks in advance for your insights :D",

There are specific audiences we want to reach, but for the sake of not getting too much in the weeds, they are often broadly defined and we are not using a data onboarder like Liveramp to use the same exact audience for planning/targeting/measuring everywhere. We often use a mix of 1PD (largely to understand current customer status or not for prospecting) 2PD from retailers, and 3PD to target. We track site visits, but don't rely on site conversions for sales purposes like an e-com advertiser would / don't have hard ROAS goals that you can plug and play into a buying platform or something like that. We use a few main measurement platforms as our central place to measure all partner activity.\n\nThere is a lot of talk of the need for clean rooms in advertising for planning/activation/measurement.

It's not just the ad call APIs, it's also the venue management API, the audience APIs, and the like. Right now we do so much manually because it's too much too build.\n\nDo you have any advice for tools that could make this easier? We have our own CMS and I feel like we're drowning in API work and inventory management. That's not even including the wave of CTV integrations coming our way.",

When I started in the role (1st job in advertising) Programmatic Solutions Consultants were one of the biggest partner teams I collaborated with, and over the last 3 years I have come to be very fascinated with what they do, and have learned some theory and basics of programmatic advertising and it interests me greatly. The way my current role is designed, I have learnt very little of campaign set up and execution, (since everything is done by Ad Operations team) and next to nothing of campaign management since I am not involved with connecting with the client to give optimization/delivery/strategy advice.  \nI am looking to move into the PSC role, but those teams only work from EU/APAC/NA (i am based in India) so I am forced to look for jobs outside my company, but there are not a lot of openings. I am going through job descriptions of roles that interest me, but they have a LARGE list of skills required such as:  \n\\-Skilled in multiple DSPs like TTD, DV360, ADSP  \n\\-Advanced Excel/PowerBI/SQL  \n\\-Some asking for experience with SSP, DMP, Optimizations\n\nI honestly do not know where to begin my learnings as I am starting from scratch. I have gone through Youtube playlists, and have learned the basics of the programmatic ecosystem, and I have seen tutorials of DV360 and ADSP Walkthroughs, but I don't know how to put the learnings into practice and develop it as a skill. If anyone would like to mentor me and/or give any tips or advice, I welcome you to share your thoughts!\n\nThank you so much in advance for taking the time to read and reply. Appreciate it as I desperately try to build a career in something that is hopefully my passion! :D ",

I’ve been thinking a lot about curation recently and wanted to get everyone’s take on it and see if I’m missing something.\n\nThe Good\n- 3rd party curators with proprietary data (publishers, data aggregators) can now directly own and monetize their data\n- DSP throttling rates reduced because less requests are sent to the DSP, reducing costs for DSPs and SSPs alike. \n\nThe Bad\n- Curators are 1 step removed from traditional HoK teams, causing additional back and forth, ambiguity, and lack of clarity when executing.\n- This distance between teams results in issues with activation, and troubleshooting either doesn’t happen or takes much longer.\n\nThe Ugly\n- Curation isn’t transparent, and there’s really no way to validate that you’re getting additional value compared to curating yourself or within the DSP.\n- It primarily seems to have created an industry of companies acting as a middleman and taking a 30% fee, leading to less competitive bids and a higher percentage of advertisers’ money going to fees rather than media.\n\nTo me this seems like it cannot and should not last, but maybe I’m missing a crucial aspect of it? If I were to put myself in the shoes of a CMO at, for instance, Adidas, how could I justify that this is a net benefit for my brand? \n",

I work for a small agency and handle traditional media negotiation (billboard, radio, broadcast) and some other parts of day to day operations. I took it upon myself to try and learn about new avenues to help our clients but I’ve been really struggling with navigating the streaming realm. I have no mentor or superior that I can ask for advice and I also handle our accounting so I’m stretched pretty thin as far as self education time goes. \n\nI got started in broadcast buying through the agency and with streaming on the rise, we have tried out Compulse, Premion, iheart and spectrum. I feel like all these offerings are bogus. I’ve never really seen a lift and everyone we work with can’t answer any of our questions. \n\nAt this point, I can’t tell if it is a competency issue or we have been barking up the wrong tree. This space is so dense and I’m doing the work of 3 people already. I don’t want to waste our clients money, but I also don’t have the luxury of time to learn how to buy direct at the moment. Hopefully the agency hires on people to do what I do full time so I have the space to learn soon. I’m wondering if any one else has been in this position or could offer some advice. I’m not sure where the heck to start but I’m in over my head and sprinting in place. ",

Over the last 3 years I’ve been the main internal manager for our CTV offerings including some programmatic and PMP deals. This is a relatively new venture for our company so it’s pretty bare bones. We work with Freewheel as our DSP but use Excel for everything else. \n\nI’m looking to head in the direction of the CTV stuff and way from linear in my next role. Right now I do both but don’t have hands on DSP experience as I deal with mainly the IOs and collating the sales data. I’m looking to increase my salary as well which has stagnated over the last 4 years. \n\nI’d appreciate any advice on certifications I can get or any advice in general so I am fully prepared to go on interviews for CTV roles.

I am currently helping to manage several insurance ad campaigns with daily budgets in the multi-six figures and am expanding strategies beyond traditional DSP platforms.\n\nI am actively establishing partnerships with inventory providers across various device types to facilitate direct and meaningful collaborations. These partnerships leverage unique placement opportunities and personalized campaign strategies that aren't possible with traditional DSPs.\n\nAdditionally, I’ve started testing a new model that offers residual revenue streams for agencies interested in diversifying beyond conventional ad buys. This model is designed to add a continual income component, providing ongoing benefits from established campaigns.\n\nIf you're doing media buys and are currently connecting with inventory partners directly (not just DSP campaigns) or you're open to doing so and you're  open to exploring collaborations, please DM so we can discuss further. I look forward to chatting.",
