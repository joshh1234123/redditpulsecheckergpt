      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\n**Context** \\- I do my media buying in GAM and I work with a third party company for my DCO campaigns. They send me javascript ad tags split per format and per audience segment that I integrate into my campaign. The creatives are adserved on their end. Right now, I tend to have one line item split per format and per audience segment (Line item 1 - Car intent, Line item 2 - Electric cars, Line item 3 - Diesel, and so on) as I have different creatives for each segment. Sometimes the images will change, or the text inside, or both.\n\n**Goal** \\- I am trying to optimise the number of my Line items by not splitting them per audience segment. The goal is to have one Line item for my 300x250 (for example) and put all my audience segments inside.\n\n**Problem** \\- I don't know how I can send the info to the third party company so they know which ad to show to the user. How would they know to show the Car intent creative vs the Electric cars one? Are there any GAM macros that can be used to pass on this information? I saw the %%PATTERN:key%% macro and I think that might be the answer, but I don't quite understand how that works. Any help would be greatly appreciated and sorry if there's information that's missing. Do let me know if you need clarifications 🙏\n\nThanks!",

We've been told by the agency we work with (who uses DV360 and TTD) that they won't run anything for us without a $200K minimum ad spend commitment. Obviously, that's a bit steep for us - so is there a platform / DSP I can access on my own (whether paid or unpaid) that I could go around the agency and buy CTV placements on our own? Would there still be minimum spend requirements even in these cases? Would love to learn more. Thanks to any kind programmatic person who knows more about CTV than I do :)",

I evaluate our tech / partner stacks, onboard new vendors, apply new industry trends into our buying methodologies, evaluate business margins, etc. I’m a bit of a ‘jack of all trades’ - I understand most aspects of the larger digital landscape, worked in the ad tagging / GTM space for a bit, account management work, oversee programmatic media buys, etc. but the MAIN thing I haven’t done is hands on keyboard buying. Currently my job is to ensure that our agency product suite is profitable, driving results and keeping up with industry changes.\n\nI love my current product role, but I’m trying to work out how I transition my experience into a role that’s outside of agency life in the future. Do I need to have hands on keyboard buying experience to go client / vendor side or can you get roles on media teams with my kind of experience?\n\nAppreciate any help or guidance - feeling a bit ‘lost in the sauce’ at the moment, especially since I don’t want to do the agency life forever.",

No matter how good your safety & quality measures in place are, the bad guys are one step ahead most of the time.\n\nAllowlists allow you to gain substantially more control over:\n\n1️⃣ (True) Inventory Quality\nhand-picked, performance based inventory will push your inventory quality to a new level — moving beyond vanity metrics that can be easily manipulated by bots & fraudsters (like Clicks/CTR) to true business outcomes\n\n2️⃣ Brand Safety/Suitability & Ad Fraud\nyou can’t control the incoming flood with a blocklist approach, once you’ve updated your blocklists there will be new malicious pages on the horizon immediately after — it’s a game you can’t win, not even talking about the time effort here\n\n3️⃣ Carbon Emissions\ntools & services like Scope3 allow you to measure carbon emissions produced by the Apps/URLs within your campaigns (gCO2PM — average grams of carbon per 1000 impressions) — making your programmatic Allowlists greener, normally goes hand in hand with improved performance, since it washes out slow & bloated pages with high ad density & refresh frequency — that’s a win/win\n\n🤔 But aren’t Allowlists limiting my potential reach?\n\nBased on my learnings this shouldn’t be your concern, there is a lot of good quality inventory out there, which is normally way higher than the advertisers’ budget buckets. Don’t get me wrong — the long tail definitely has its raison d’être, but please be aware of the insane amount of bullshit which is still living inside the programmatic ecosystem — don’t fall into this trap.\n\n👀 So, how do I start my Allowlist journey?\n\n1️⃣ Deep-Dive Reports from existing campaigns:\n- which Apps/URLs deliver post-view/click value?\n- which of them do deliver it in a good relation? (CPA/ROAS/Scalability)\n- Clicks/CTR/Viewability/VTR alone are not enough, they can be used as a secondary metric, but bots are trimmed to fake just that as good as possible — focus on true business value\n\n2️⃣ Research:\n- which premium websites/portals/apps are there in my target market?\n- which niche websites/portals/apps are there in my target market?\n- always think locally AND globally\n- leverage AI to support your (deep) research\n\n3️⃣ Manual Checks — you have to form your own opinion for each website:\n- how is the page speed?\n- how many placements are there (ad-density)?\n- how often are those placements refreshing?\n- how is the overall content-/website-quality?\n\nWhat do you think about the future of the open market?",

Can we get series/show/episodic pass back? \nAnyone heard of them trying to mimic DAI/SAI but in video? I’m skeptical about how that would even work.

Break down how the ecosystem works—who’s involved, how ads are bought and sold—using a clear, real-world analogy. Keep it straightforward, no fluff or jargon.\n2. **Teach it like I’m a seasoned industry pro** Let’s get into the advanced stuff: the underlying mechanics, the hidden levers, who the real players are, and how the value chain actually operates from end to end. Where are the bottlenecks or inefficiencies, and what parts of the process are ripe for disruption or improvement?\n3. **Coach me like a mentor** Walk me step-by-step through how to plan, launch, and optimize a successful programmatic campaign. What are the key decisions I need to make? What common mistakes should I avoid? What blind spots do even experienced marketers tend to miss?\n4. **Think like a strategist** Put programmatic in the larger context of media, marketing, and business growth. How does it connect to other channels? Why does it matter more than ever? Where’s it headed next?\n5. **Summarize like a top-tier consultant** Give me a concise, reusable cheat sheet I can use to teach others or revisit when I need clarity—bonus points for frameworks, flowcharts, mental models, or quick-reference principles I can apply right away.\n\nPlease include real-world examples, cite references where useful, and anticipate the confusing parts. I’m looking for clarity, depth, and speed—so I can walk away with both confidence and practical know-how.",

The main goal was actually to generate ad copies generation according to their customer persona.\n\n**Process & Idea**\n\nTo keep it short here are the main cases we worked on:  \nStep 1 - Build quick customer persona\n\n* Either from scratch\n* From existing purchase data collected from site visit, purchases, etc.\n\nStep 2 - Select Ad format\n\n* Easy format: Search Ad copies\n* \"Hard format\": DIsplay Ad Copies (banners)\n\nStep 3 - Generate Ad Copies Variants\n\n* Generate half a dozen of ad copies per persona\n* Customize headline, core text, CTA and / or background image according to persona characteristics\n\nEventually, we implemented everything (manually) into Google Ads & Meta. We had a single campaign, with one ad group per persona with all the corresponding creatives. Mmaybe we should have had one campaign per persona with a specific targeting? Not sure, sounds like over-engineering.\n\nWe also implemented a campaign with the same set-up but only with a few ad copies and a single ad group (basically what my friends would have done without my help).\n\n**Outcome**\n\nGot +25% CTR, -13% CPA (purchase event), cost of production is almost an estimate but we estimated -50% versus fiverr or upwork freelancers, time of production once the script was ready was like -90%.\n\nGot a few ad groups that performed really well, so that did super bad, hopefully the one performing well compensated for the low performance.\n\n**Question**\n\nSo obviously first results sound very promising for sure. But that's only for a couple of small brands, where the testing set-up might be challengeable.\n\nAnd there are might be more complicated cases to handle.\n\nWhat's your feeling on that? Do you think brands could be interested? Small ones, big ones, agencies? I just feel we had something interesting between our hands, but also super early stage / raw code assets.\n\nNot sure what do with that next and whether it could benefit more media buyers.\n\nHappy to take feedbacks.\n\nCheers",

I'd be very happy to get a job in the same industry but no luck yet. I can do both buy side/publisher side tasks.\n\nI can't do sales and I don't have a lot of connections since I've only been here since 2021. I can do data analysis but it takes a while, other than those two I can do anything that is within the ad ops/rev ops/tech part of the programmatic/adops role. I can send CV if needed so you can see if its a fit.\n\nI do speak with an accent and sometimes I pronounce words wrong because I learned it from reading and not from hearing but I do know the literal meaning. Example: Sick = Unwell, not sick like awesome or whatever its been. I also don't have a lot of personality or my personality doesn't translate well in American context so might be a bit weird/odd/awkward. Ex says he only understand half of what I'm saying most of the time so I figured that might be for everyone else. English is not my first language so street/slang/pop culture/local reference is almost zero.\n\nHopefully I'll see my future manager in here.",
