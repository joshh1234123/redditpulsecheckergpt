      "content": "How granularly are y'all typically breaking out your line items? I feel like platforms and traders often advocate for consolidation, but in my mind the fewer you have the less opportunities for optimization, and different supply has inherently different value that you would be bidding the same price for if not broken out. \n\nI'm getting pushback for wanting online video line items broken out by audience (2), instream vs. outstream (2), and mobile web/mobile app/desktop (3) for a total of 12 line items. I understand not having budget spread too thin across many line items, but that's not a risk here as the budget is significant. I would think separate line items for instream vs. outstream should be default for any advertiser so that bids can be assigned based on their objectively disparate value. \n\n I'm curious if there is any *actual* benefit from an auto-optimization perspective to have fewer line items with less restrictions, or if it really doesn't make a difference since the campaign will optimize between all the line items anyway.",

Through that, I had the chance to work directly with Google to set up Google Ad Manager (GAM) and Google AdX for monetizing some of our websites. So I’ve got some basic hands-on experience with GAM, but I haven’t worked with platforms like The Trade Desk (TTD), DV360, or other DSPs yet.\n\nIn addition, I interned at a confectionery company where I worked in both accounting and marketing, which helped me build a solid foundation in business operations and campaign strategy from a brand-side perspective.\n\nI’m based near New York City and can easily commute. I’m looking for entry-level roles, internships, or even contract work where I can get real experience and grow. I’m also open to remote opportunities.\n\nIf anyone has:\n\t•\tSuggestions on certifications worth taking (TTD Edge Academy, Google Skillshop, etc.)\n\t•\tCompanies/agencies in NYC that are open to beginners\n\t•\tAny tips on breaking into the space without a traditional ad tech background\n\nI’d really appreciate it. I’m motivated, a fast learner, and ready to dive in.\n\nThanks a ton in advance!\n",

However, regardless of the hype and the promising talk around platforms such as Magnite, Pubmatic, Equativ Maestro, and Xandr, our daily revenue rarely exceeds $50 on average per deal (some even less.)\n\nI’m reaching out to see if anyone with experience in setting up deals via these curation platforms is seeing different results or if I’m missing something crucial in our strategy. Is it an industry-wide challenge at the moment, or should we be tweaking our approach to drive more significant revenue numbers? Any tips, insights, or experiences would be greatly appreciated!\n\nHow on earth is curation commercially viable given the amount of back forth needed just to get an agency to take a meeting, agree to set up and deal…for $50 gross revenue a day?\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts.\nWhat are your strategies for making the juice worth the squeeze in these deals?",

Are they more experimental or cautious?\n\n\nIf anyone here has worked with or inside an indie agency, or collaborated with one on the brand/vendor side — your insights would mean a lot.

As far as I know, my agency doesn't use API's at all outside of what the dev team has created to make their lives easier. Things like campaign setup, creative builds/updates, and reporting are all manual processes. I want to work with our dev team to build a dashboard that we can use to manage all of this and more across multiple platforms, but I don't have any experience or reference for the idea.  Any help, advice, and examples would be helpful. Thanks in advance.  ",

The feedback was that they’re a fast-paced environment and need someone more **agile and adaptable**.\n\nIn another interview, I adjusted and mentioned **Agility, Flexibility, and Strategic Thinking**, but then got told that my skillset might not align with the role.\n\nI’m now confused – what are the top 3 skills UK companies are *actually* expecting from candidates in programmatic roles, especially for AM or strategist positions? And how can I tailor my answer without sounding too generic or trying too hard?\n\nWould really appreciate insights from anyone who’s hiring, recently hired, or has cracked this in the UK market.\n\nThanks in advance!",

I have literally 8k clicks in Xandr, but only 2k sessions in Ga4. Plus, the bounce rate is so low, at 5%. \n\n\n\nMy suggestions are 2:\n\n* Ga4 is considering them users that already have interacted with my client's website, so thats why it doesnt atribute the other 6k (so high anyways) users. \n* Ga4 is literally stealing from Xandr\n   * I spoke with my microsoft representative already, says a clicks on  xandr is a clicks, and the % of discrepancy is not normal.\n   * UTMS are well set also.\n\n\n\n  \nWhat do you guys think!?\n\nApart form obvious aspects, i think such a big discrepancy is not normal. Im literally reporting clicks for them since the difference betwees DSP and Ga4 makes it imposible to work otherwise.\n\n\n\nHappy to read y'all",

I don't think the mods are looking at my posts because I've got one that's been awaiting approval for a year. Anyway...*\n\n\n\nSo, I've officially been the only Ad Operations Specialist at my agency for 3 or 4 years now. As far as I know, I'm the first person to hold that title, and it's a role I'd never heard of until my manager at the time told me that's where I would be doing going forward (started as a Junior SEO Specialist). I'm mostly self taught, but I think I'm pretty solid relative to what's asked of me. The problem I'm seeing is that I have no direction in terms of how to improve. As mentioned, I'm the only ad operations specialist, so there's nobody to really learn from. So my questions to you all:\n\n1. Generally speaking, what should I know/be learning?\n2. What is something ad ops isn't technically expected to do that's still good to at least understand?\n3. How much of what you know/understand depends on what's been asked of you in your role?\n4. What would you consider junior level, mid level, and senior level in terms of ad ops?",

      "content": "April 2025 saw overall CPMs remain flat month-over-month, with display CPMs up 3.9% and video CPMs down 31.1%. Year-over-year, CPMs declined 25%, reflecting a post-election dip in political ad spend and ongoing economic uncertainty. **Fill rates also dropped from** **42% to 38%**. Notably, **AdX saw a slight QoQ CPM lift**, bucking the trend, while **Amazon (-29%)** and **IX (-18%)** experienced the **biggest declines**.\n\nEarly in the month, lighter advertiser demand led to higher win rates, but bidding intensified mid- to late-month as budgets ramped up, peaking in the final days. To adapt, publishers should **adjust floor prices dynamically**, lowering them at the start of the month and increasing as demand surges, especially in the last 10 days. Leveraging **real-time optimization** and **diversifying demand sources** will be key to stabilizing revenue as market volatility continues.\n\n**CPM Trends:**\n\n* **MoM Growth:** Display CPMs ↑3.9%, Video CPMs ↓31.1%, Overall CPM flat\n* **YoY Change:** YoY: Display CPMs ↓29.7%, Video CPMs ↓13.3%, Overall CPM ↓25%\n\n[check out the full report](https://databeat.io/blog/us-programmatic-trends-april-25/) ",

I've read up on StackAdapt, [Simpli.fi](http://Simpli.fi), and Basis and was wondering if other ones I should check out. Also if there are any qualities I should look out for in a DSP from a small business perspective, that'll be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks again in advance!  \n  \nBest,    ",
