Do These Metrics Help Plan Future Actions?](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7318629227522650113/)\n\nAs suggested by the title of this article, we might have several questions about the effectiveness of our digital marketing campaigns. Depending on what we want to achieve, we decide which KPIs to consider. But are we sure that our key performance indicators are the most suitable for revealing the truth? To answer this question, we must always keep in mind our business objective.\n\nIn the previous example, does the metric answer the questions: Are we reaching the right audience? Is the message we are communicating truly effective? Are the channels we are using appropriate?\n\nWe can attract a high volume of traffic to our website, but it doesn’t guarantee a rise in online sales. In the best scenario, it might provide just a piece of information. The Instagram followers in the example above may therefore be considered a vanity metric.\n\nWhat are vanity metrics? They are metrics that are not directly related to the main business objectives and don’t provide useful insights about the possible actions we need to adopt in the future.Vanity metrics may look good in a presentation, but they lack substance. \n\nMeanwhile, always referring to the previous example, ROAS, ROI, and CPA can provide a better picture. These metrics might be considered actionable metrics because they align with the business objective and eventually indicate actions to take if needed.\n\nBut how can we distinguish vanity metrics from actionable ones? It all depends on our business objective and the context. Our metrics provide significant information when we consider the situation around them. Let’s say that our campaign works at the upper part of the purchase funnel. Its aim is to bring traffic to our website and build brand awareness. In this case, average engagement rates and the time spent by each user on certain pages would better indicate whether our campaign is achieving its goal. In this scenario, our KPIs would help identify which actions to take if needed.\n\nThe concepts of vanity metrics and actionable metrics are not new to the digital marketing industry, but this important distinction is often neglected.\n\nResuming, ask yourself these three questions: 1) Does this metric tie to our business goals? 2) Can this metric inform future decisions? 3) Is the context around this metric understood?\n\nAnd you what do you think? I would like to hear your opinion on this matter. I’m looking forward to read your comments.",

      "content": "Ad waste is a well known problem in the digital marketing industry, often nourished by MFA websites (Made for Advertising). MFA websites are those created exclusively with the intent to generate large quantities of bid requests to skim off the top of advertisers’ budgets.\n\nAs we will see later, these are neither negligible amounts of money nor insignificant percentages of impressions.\n\n# How can the adoption of vanity metrics incentivize ad waste?\n\nOften, brands and agencies use metrics such as CTR, CPM, and viewability as reference points. In general, these metrics are not closely related to the business objective, at least not directly. If brands decide to use these metrics to measure the success or failure of a campaign, agencies have little choice but to adjust to their clients’ expectations.\n\nOn the sell side, publishers are also affected by these choices because they, too, are pushed to create content that better aligns with CTR, CPM, viewability, and similar metrics; otherwise, they struggle to properly monetize their work.\n\nIt is within this vicious cycle that MFA websites find their space. And now, thanks to artificial intelligence, which previously required days, these websites can be created in mere hours. This has dramatically increased the number of MFA sites.\n\n# Do MFA websites involve only small publishers?\n\nActually, the record shows that MFA websites have been linked to well-known and prestigious names. The scandal involving the Forbes subdomain ([www3.forbes.com](http://www3.forbes.com/)) was even reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThere have also been cases where MFA websites were included in inventory sources within deals.\n\n# What are MFA websites?\n\nMFA websites are created solely to divert as many funds as possible from advertisers’ budgets. They generate an abnormal number of bid requests.\n\n# What are the characteristics of MFA websites?\n\nThese are the most notable traits:\n\n* Ad overcrowding (at least double the usual amount)\n* Ads that appear partially or totally overlapped\n* Low-quality content\n* Web pages refreshed frequently\n* Rarely appearing in search engines\n* Traffic sourced entirely from paid display, video, and social ads\n* Circumvention of frequency caps\n* Bid requests marked as viewable that actually are not\n\n# What are the ad waste numbers?\n\nAccording to ANA (Association of National Advertisers):\n\n* 15% of the annual global programmatic ad spend goes to MFA websites.\n* 21% of global programmatic impressions in a year are served on MFA websites.\n\n# Given these numbers, why does the industry still place so much importance on vanity metrics?\n\nIt’s a trade-off. Serving ads only on high-quality inventory would reduce scalability and increase CPM, two factors that agencies and brands are highly sensitive to.\n\nHowever, investing in high-quality inventory yields better results in terms of actionable metrics, those directly linked to a brand’s business objective. These metrics also provide valuable insights on what next steps to take, if needed.\n\nThere is no doubt that spending at least part of the budget on MFA websites helps reduce CPM and improve CTR and viewability. However, it also creates a poor user experience and ultimately harms brand reputation.\n\n# The steady decline in third-party cookie availability has made inventory quality even more crucial.\n\n# What can be done? Is the industry taking action to mitigate ad waste?\n\nFortunately, progress is happening!\n\n* Xandr and AppNexus have launched the Inventory Quality program to verify inventory source quality.\n* Tech vendors specializing in bid request analysis are developing new methodologies and standards to prevent ads from being served on MFA websites.\n* Industry bodies such as ANA, 4A’s (American Association of Advertising Agencies), WFA (World Federation of Advertisers), and ISBA (Incorporated Society of British Advertisers) have joined forces to establish a standardized approach for identifying MFA websites.\n\n# In summary, MFA websites and ad waste have finally been put in the spotlight.\n\nAdditionally, **programmatic players are growing increasingly aware of the issue.**",

My main concern is that our CTV is running across curated RON PMPs with big name publishers like LG Ads, Nexxen, Samba TV and Pubmatic.  These are large CTV providers who should be passing quality avails to these deals, but we're seeing filter rates ranging from 25-50%.\n\nHas anyone seen this on their campaigns and understand why the rate can be so high?\n\nDoes anyone know if there are CTV specific issues with the traffic filter that could be causing this?\n\n  \nThanks in advance any way to help me troubleshoot or direct their supply team would be great!",

When a deal sends bid requests to a DSP I know the DSP will only analyze 1/1000 requests and log that information, but will this sort of logic of only listening to a certain portion of bid requests also apply to bidding? So if I were leveraging a deal and the deal was sending out of geo inventory 80% of the time, would we exclude far more than 80% of avails because of sampling or would the DSP still listen to each and every request before deciding whether to bid/not bid?\n\nThanks!",

All configurable:\n```toml\n[layers.reducer]\nmodel = \"openrouter:anthropic/claude-3-haiku\"  # $0.25/1M tokens\n\n[layers.primary] \nmodel = \"openrouter:anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet\"  # $3/1M tokens\n```\n\n🤖 **MCP server integration:**\nAdd specialized AI agents through configuration alone:\n```toml\n[mcp.servers.code_reviewer]\ncommand = \"npx\"\nargs = [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything\"]\nmodel = \"openrouter:anthropic/claude-3-haiku\"\n```\n\nNow you have `agent_code_reviewer()` available in your session.\n\n🖼️ **Multimodal CLI:**\n```\n> /image screenshot.png\n> \"What's wrong with this error dialog?\"\n```\n\nVisual debugging in your terminal.\n\n**Real Impact:**\n- Reduced my AI development costs by ~70% through intelligent routing\n- Can compose AI workflows without writing custom scripts\n- Full transparency into what I'm spending and why\n\n**Example session:**\n```\n$ octomind session\n[~$0.00] > \"Analyze this React component for performance issues\"\n[AI uses cheap model for initial analysis: ~$0.02]\n\n[~$0.02] > \"Suggest a complete refactor with modern patterns\"  \n[AI escalates to premium model for complex reasoning: ~$0.15]\n\n[~$0.17] > /report\nSession: $0.17 total, 2 requests, 3 tool calls, 45s duration\n```\n\nThe tool supports OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare providers with real-time cost comparison.\n\n**Installation:**\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muvon/octomind/main/install.sh | bash\nexport OPENROUTER_API_KEY=\"your_key\"\noctomind session\n```\n\n**GitHub:** https://github.com/muvon/octomind\n\nI'm curious what other developers think about cost transparency in AI tools. Are you tracking your AI spending? What would make AI development workflows more efficient for you?\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for the interest! A few people asked about the MCP integration - it uses the Model Context Protocol to let you add any compatible AI server as a specialized agent. No coding required, just configuration.\n",

      "content": "During my career, I have often seen CTR taken as the central metric to determine the success or failure of a campaign. Undoubtedly, CTR is the first metric we look at to see if our ads are interesting to our targeted audience. But does CTR tell us the entire story? For example, an ad might enjoy a high CTR because it is compelling or its imagery is eye-catching, yet if the landing page or offer doesn’t resonate with visitors, those clicks won’t turn into conversions or revenue. This can mislead marketers into believing that their campaign is performing well based solely on an impressive CTR, while the factors that actually drive business growth; such as conversion rate, cost per acquisition, and customer lifetime value (depending on the business objective); remain unoptimized.\n\nIn other words, focusing only on CTR; even as a tactic; ignores the crucial elements of the customer's journey, such as the user experience on the conversion path or the quality of the traffic being driven to the website. In essence, while a high CTR indicates that an ad is attracting attention, it doesn’t guarantee that the visitors are engaging with the product or service in a way that advances business growth.\n\nLooking beyond CTR to more actionable metrics; like conversion rate, customer acquisition cost, product page views, average time spent on those pages, and engaged sessions (to name a few examples); provides a clearer picture of what your campaign ultimately drives in tangible results. This shift from vanity metrics to actionable ones ensures that your optimization efforts are aligned with what truly matters for long-term success.\n\nA definition of vanity metrics versus actionable metrics that I like a lot is: good metrics should drive decisions, not distractions. Actionable metrics lead to real business growth, not just better-looking reports.\n\nSome may object that CTR and other vanity metrics are used in the early stages of the purchase funnel, and that they should be viewed as part of a global strategy that, in the lower funnel phases, also considers actionable metrics. But the fact is that vanity metrics can be used for short-term directional decisions, **yet you always need something in place to check the relationship with lower funnel value**; and correct it if necessary. Does an ad with a high CTR have a lower conversion rate than an ad with a lower CTR? It could mean that the ad copy, creative, or CTA; although attractive and clickable; did not accurately represent your actual offer.\n\n**As the saying goes, \"what you measure grows.\"** The metrics you choose as your KPIs will determine what you focus on. Choosing the right or wrong KPI will impact everything from your strategy and execution to the campaigns you run and the results you achieve. Hence, it is crucial to ensure that your KPIs are not vanity metrics but are meaningful and drive business impact.\n\n**Let’s return to the second question in the title: Does optimizing for CTR lead to serving on junk inventories?** \n\n**I would ask you to run this test**: If you have a campaign with a goal of increasing CTR and a conversion pixel implemented on the landing page that fires every time a user lands on it after clicking your ads, compare the number of clicks with the number of post-click conversions. Do the two numbers match? If not, how large is the discrepancy? According to playbooks and help center articles, a 20% discrepancy is considered acceptable. A discrepancy between the number of clicks and the landing page conversion events might be due to several reasons:\n\n\n\n* Slow loading of the landing page due to internet connection issues\n* Fat-finger errors on mobile devices\n* Pixel implementation issues\n* Third-party cookie restrictions or ad blockers\n* Users clicking on the ad but immediately abandoning the landing page\n* And many other reasons not mentioned above.\n\n\n\nBut what if the discrepancy is 30%, 40%, 50%, or even above 60%? **Mostly, such discrepancies are due to fraudulent clicks generated by bots**. In general, these malignant codes are situated on MFA websites; for this reason, it is very important to ensure that your campaigns serve on good quality inventories.\n\nOptimizing campaigns based on actionable metrics also means you are serving on good quality inventories. Even when discussing traffic quality, if you focus more on GA4 average time spent by users on product pages, it would consequently improve the quality of traffic (in terms of engaged sessions, for example). Conversely, if you want your campaign to maximize the number of clicks, the system might favor serving on inventories from MFA websites; which, although offering lower CPMs, provide a bad user experience and ultimately discredit the brand reputation.",

They run an interactive CTV ad, where the viewer can choose to \"learn more\" or \"shop now,\" and the brand uses location + retail POS data to track incremental sales lift (vs a control group) at stores like Target or Walgreens.\n\n**Question:**\n\nAs someone in programmatic/media, do you think this kind of campaign setup is compelling or realistic? Is anything missing that would make it more useful or actionable to a media buyer or RMN/CMN partner?\n\nI'm looking to test the concept before it goes in front of stakeholders. Would *love* any thoughts if you've got 2 mins, especially if you're in CPG, retail media, or measurement.\n\nThanks so much!",

Since our movie campaigns don't deliver conversions and our primary goal is to generate clicks. I'm contemplating switching the objective to clicks and using CTR as the KPI. Although there is a concern with floodlight tracking, if you switch to clicks, you can't have floodlights for tracking clicks and we'd have to rely on Google's system tracking. Which option would work best for DG lines considering clicks is the main goal? Would not having floodlights  result in a major loss in tracking clicks? \n\nPS - The highest CTR we've seen across DG campaigns is 1.3%.",

      "content": "I recently dug into some domain coverage issues recently and surprised by how overlooked ads.txt still is. It’s crazy how something as “basic” as maintaining and strategically expanding ads.txt can impact programmatic performance, especially for publishers working with multiple SSPs or juggling subdomains.\n\nIn one case, we worked with a publisher whose ads.txt had a bunch of gaps: missing demand partners, outdated entries, the usual suspects. After a thorough cleanup and making sure everything matched their current setup, their domain coverage improved significantly, and revenue became much more stable.\n\nHas anyone else had similar experiences with ads.txt tweaks? If there’s interest, Here’s a more detailed write-up of the process we followed- [Read here](https://databeat.io/case-studies/ads-txt-optimization/%20?utm_source=reddit&&utm_medium=organic_social&&utm_campaign=ad.txt+case+study)\n\n",

Ideally looking for platforms that offer:\n\n\t•\tPrecise location targeting (down to meters if possible)\n\t•\tReal-time footfall attribution or visit tracking\n\t•\tStrong mobile inventory and proximity-based triggers\n\t•\tEasy integration with offline conversion data\n\nBonus points if it works well in LATAM, but global recs are welcome too.\nWhich DSPs have you had the best results with? Any to avoid? 🙏\n",
