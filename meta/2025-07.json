Is it straightforward stats and trends showing how your campaign is trending/improving as you've launched or do you also put together \"stories\" or  aha narratives every month to show what's working and what's not working and deep and dramatic executive summary type wins and losses each month?  \n\nMy problem with that approach is \"what's working\" is such a generic term and it's not like you're going to have a \"story\" every month. If something has a lower performance for a KPI you are tracking the beauty of programmatic is real time optimizations usually then don't spend as much towards that lower performing tactic (unless there are scale issues with other better performing tactics with just limited inventory or audience sizes). \n\nAnd when speaking of KPI's how do you get benchmarks for various campaigns such as a lower funnel campaign ROAS - mid funnel DPVR or page view rate as I never look at CTR's except when just measuring the difference in performance between a creative or audiences. I mean there are things that can have better results for one KPI but not for another so you don't want to say that other thing isn't \"working\" in totality.  \n\nI've already had this conversation with Chat GPT just curious what some real world programmatic peeps like me do - or if you have an awesome analytics department that handles dumbing down reports for high level executives with MBA degrees, ha.",

I'm feeling a bit lost, and seeking advice on next steps for my career. \n\n  \nA little about me:\n\nI am a partnerships manager at an ad server/SSP tasked with growing my partners' programmatic ads businesses through developing and executing data-driven yield strategies across web, search, and mobile app ecosystems. My responsibilities include being a trusted advisor, providing best practices and guidance on our ad products/platforms but my overall objective is to drive revenue for my partners and for the Company. I'm in a senior role, which has given me opportunities to coach and develop junior team members. My manager and skip-level see me as their go-to subject matter expert. I do not have any direct reports.\n\nThe role is great because of the autonomy I am given for business impact, in addition my established brand/visibility with my leadership team. However, I'm feeling stagnant in terms of developmental opportunities and there's no business need for another IC L+1 on this team (low likelihood of promo). \n\nI enjoy programmatic advertising and generally, the ad tech ecosystem - specifically, how the industry is fast-paced, heavily data-driven, and necessitates constant learning. I also am one of the most \"technical\" ICs on my team, with deep product knowledge on ad serving/delivery, and competent understanding of web technologies. I like the idea of becoming more technical in SQL/Python to enhance my data analysis tools as well.\n\nHowever, I am at a juncture in my career: do I invest more time in the partnerships ladder and become a manager, or explore something new like data engineering or product management? Again, I love data-driven decision making and in the AI era, data is the new oil. From a PM perspective, I feel like my programmatic experience has given me a unique perspective, allowing me to understand the relationship between tech, data, and user behavior.\n\nTo help frame what's next, I'd like to optimize for higher salary ceiling and learning opportunities.\n\nI would love advice from the experienced programmatic folks here who have successfully navigated their own careers or transitioned into a different role:\n\n1. How can I broaden my skill set beyond to enrich my career in programmatic? Are there specific skills  that I should be learning?\n2. Career Trajectory: Would love to hear success stories of people who have transitioned from partnership roles to other positions within technology companies? What skills, experiences, or attributes were pivotal in their career progression?\n\nI genuinely appreciate any guidance or insights you can offer. Your collective advice will hopefully help me make informed decisions about my professional journey.\n\nLooking forward to reading your responses, also very excited to continue this journey within the programmatic and tech realm, with a potential venture into a new career path!",

Even for basic tasks, they’re asking questions they’ve already been trained on. I make a point of being approachable and thorough in my training, but it feels like the information just isn’t sticking and no one’s proactive. There seems to be a lack of critical thinking and initiative these days. Anyone else noticing this?",

We don't use an ad server for third-party conversion verification, so I'm trying to align the conversion attribution as closely as possible between the two platforms. The settings look the exact same in each platform, however Basis' conversion count is MUCH higher than TTD, and conversions (viewthrough and clickthrough) are higher than regular clicks in Basis. Does anyone have advice on how to better align attribution here? Or have you seen conversions be much higher in Basis vs. TTD? Our lookback window, deduplication settings, and targeting is all the same. Thank you!!",

Things feel bleak.😑\n\nI'll start off with 3 years ago I completely changed careers to digital media. I've enjoyed it and dont regret the career change, but have been really unhappy at my job for over a year now. Our team mostly has self service clients (I truly dislike self service work, I want to be hands on keyboard really learning at this point not making recommendations and hoping for the best). We get a few short term managed service opportunities that I get to manage, but they are very infrequent. Also, many of these clients are in the platform checking everything we do so it doesnt really feel like a managed service model. When its been a client that didn't have a seat, its been fine and the few times a month client interaction was alright.\n\nIn order to move up on my team it would be like 4 client calls minimum a week on top of what I'm doing. When I started all we had were senior traders and 3 account managers so I took over tasks that really were for traders and account managers (basically anything from coordinator through 6 years of experience was free game while the team was built).\n\nWithout these client calls I can barely keep up and feel like I'm learning nothing but doing constant busy work lately. I feel like I have 0 future on this team and I'm feeling lost. I've been open and honest with my manager and above them but its either take this next role or you need to move teams (understandable). Ive tried moving teams but the past 3 jobs I've applied for at our company went outside the company, although I'd like to stay. I dislike being on the team because I feel like I dont belong and I dislike the future for me on the team and client calls for a couple hours every day in addition to consistent client emails (70 partners so our team gets bombarded) so it doesn't really feel like a promotion when I think about my future there.\n\nIve applied outside the company and cant even get an interview (some feedback was not enough hands on keyboard experience). Ive even applied for social and search positions but those are instant rejections (only exposed in my training). \n\nMy mental health is tanking, I really have very limited flexibility for a remote role given so much going on outside of work, I haven't gotten a promotion in almost 3 years after changing careers and taking a pay cut so  really not doing so well with $55k a year and spending more than 40 hours to get my job done with said paycut. \n\nIs there hope and is anyone working my dream job or hands on keyboard roles with limited to no client interaction?? Need advice on how to grow where you want and/or a peptalk.\n\n\nSorry for the book. 😬",

However, my background and long-term interest lie in end-to-end campaign management.\n\nMy question is:\nIf I take a support role now, will it be difficult to transition back into a campaign management position after 2–3 years?

Currently work in an AdOps role as an AM on the Publisher side. \n\nCurious to see if anyone has similar experience as well as pros/cons of either. \n\nMy experience Publisher side has been great. I went Publisher side for more client facing experience and to get a big Employer name on my resume. Growth is my biggest motivation for change as the only direct movement within the AdOps department is in people management. Those roles are pretty cutthroat and usually 25-30 competing for a role that may open up once a year at best. \n\nThe DSP role is interesting because it is pretty data-driven, has the nice benefits, and seems to have more upward roles suited for individual contributors. The data aspect also seems to be a more versatile skill than say trafficking tags for example. In the case that this role does not pan out, my plan is to pursue inventory analytics or Research on the publisher side\n\nAny downsides to leaving publisher side? Curious to hear other experiences and any advice. Thank you in advance",

Earlier I had third party audiences but hey never worked. Same with Categories: in 99% cases they spent almost zero budget and bring nothing at all. So I turn them off.\nI am talking about open auctions and mostly about B2B markets.\nWould be grateful for any tips. My team lead is very micromanaging person, so I need solid fact base to discuss the topic of using categories. Thank you for any answer",

      "content": "Hey all, I hope you can help me with something because I can’t find the solution myself.\n\nHere’s my situation: \n\nI am in Germany, so pretty strict privacy rules. \n\nWe are a small creative agency, and have a client (a hospital) which wanted a Geofence-campaign to target other hospitals. At first I tried Google display ads (still trying tbh) but they are not targeted enough, I only can pick a location with 1 km radius, especially if the hospital is in a city, 1 km radius is way too big. \n\nThen I read about DSPs (i think I understand 10% of it, I come from meta ads, don’t know anything about DSP). Some of them offered precision geofencing, but not in Germany. Or others said the reach is too small if we try to geotarget 3 hospitals and that it won’t work. \n\nThe guys from targetoo told me the same, but still created an account for me and I started advertising. Unfortunately no application after 1 week. Not even a relevant click, it’s 200 clicks total but everyone jumps off the website immediately, so I think it’s bots or people who clicked accidentally.\n\nnow the part which frustrates me: there is another agency in Germany, who offers the exact same thing: geofencing hospitals to get healthcare-worker applications and it works. So I know there is a way to make it work, i just don’t know how. \n\nSorry for the long text. If someone has an idea, I would highly appreciate it.",

I was curious what was the average % take rate of an SSP (i.e. GAM) for publishers?\n\nI'm working with large publishers in North America (Canada), and they're saying Google takes about 18-20% of what they receive in media dollars from the buy side. Is that normal for a large-scale publisher (top 5-10 publisher in the market)? In this context, it was specifically for video/CTV ad inventory via PMP/PD deals. \n\nAt first it seemed steep to me, but I'm assuming fees are higher on the sell side than on the buy side?",
