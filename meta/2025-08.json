      "content": "So the industry is a chatter about TTD stock shitting the bed for the second time in a year today. What's not being discussed is how major of a stumble this is relative to a major corporate event about to take place behind the scenes. \n\n5 years ago the clock was up on JG's stranglehold on the company and they needed to initiate a vote to extend the dual class share structure. Back then in summer 2020, the stock was lighting a fire like all tech companies, and everyone saw fit to let Jeff keep the wheel and re-examine the issue in five more years.\n\n  \nTimes up. \n\n  \nThe letter screenshot above went out to shareholders fairly recently. I don't know who from the C Suite on down thought it was a good idea to send this out with this language prior to Q2 earnings hitting the street but they were.......misguided at best. It glosses the Q4 speed bump with the assumption that all things are pointing up up up as we head into the vote being locked in September, but then yesterday happened and well.......this all screams red alert something ain't working.\n\nIn the five years since Jeff retained his total control of the company the stock is up as of today a whopping....20ish%. The S&P over the same time? ....93%\n\n  \nOver 4 years the stock is DOWN 26% while the SP is up over 40%. \n\nSince TTD started spending over $1B of investor money that could have been a 1 time dividend, is we assumed they had the best timing ever and bought at the lows they'd be up 20%, but if we assume the worst and say they bought at the peak they'd be down.......60%. Odds aren't strong they're up on that buyback right now that you could have put into the SP500 if they had just paid it out. \n\nSuffice to say: if you're not a TTD shareholder you might say so what who gives a fuck, Kokai still stinks worse than my dog's asshole. Well fair trader, keep an eye on this vote. Hard to say how its going to end up, I'm sure TTD Corp relations is on overdrive tossing blow and hookers at institutional investors to shore this up. But the numbers today paint a pretty clear picture that the last 5 years were not good by any measure, they're barely above stagnant when you realize inflation is about the same in those 5 years as TTDs stock growth. And if the vote doesn't go Jeff's way, he's going to have a new board of directors to answer to, and we'll see how that changes the companies strategies moving ahead. ",

Whereas I found 1.5M+ kids channels and there's over 150M low engagement, low quality channels that you don't really want to be on.\n\nSo I updated my tool to build custom targeting lists from a prompt input.\n\nNow you can create a tailored channel list for any audience that finds the \\~65k most relevant and engaging channels for your audience (from my analysis of 250M+). Then export that list and upload directly into DV360.\n\nHere's the link again if you want to check it out: [adshone.com](http://adshone.com/)\n\nMy focus is to make it as easy as possible for traders to find the best channels and target them. Again your feedback is very helpful, and please send me a message if you're interested in trying the tool.\n\nIf you have any audience prompts you want to try - add a comment and I'll run it through the tool and give you some summary stats / examples.",

Some claim programmatic opened the doors to more demand and better targeting, others say it pushed CPMs down and put more control in the hands of intermediaries.\n\nFrom our side as a GCPP working with various publishers, we’ve seen that the results really depend on setup, demand quality, and how inventory is packaged. In some cases optimizing formats, demand sources, and pricing rules has led to significant uplifts. In others yields stagnated or even dropped without proper management.\n\nCurious to hear from other publishers and ad ops pros here. Has programmatic truly helped your bottom line or would you go back to a more direct sales first approach if you could?",

Slower ads tend to hurt CTR and conversions even if they look more “viewable” in the metrics.  \n  \n**Market snapshot (July 2025):**  \nDisplay CPMs ↓ 0.5% MoM | ↓ 27% YoY  \nVideo CPMs ↓ 6% MoM | ↓ 21% YoY  \nMobile CPMs ↑ 4% MoM, but Desktop ↓ 13% MoM  \nCTV CPMs stood out with +55% YoY growth  \n  \n**Takeaway:**  \nViewability ≠ effectiveness. Optimizing for user experience, load times, and placement quality is more critical than chasing “slow = visible” scenarios.  \n  \nThe full dataset and breakdown (MoM/YoY, device-level, integrations, etc.), the full July Programmatic Trends report is here: [**Click Here**](https://databeat.io/blog/us-programmatic-trends-july-2025/?utm_source=reddit&&utm_medium=organic_social&&utm_campaign=us+programmatic+trends+july+2025)  \n  \nCurious for those running programmatic at scale:  \n👉 Have you seen slower/heavier creative formats showing “better” viewability in your environments? How are you balancing that with user experience?",

Looking for some advice on creating a VAST tag for a client’s video ad placement. Here’s the scoop:\n\nOur client’s placing a video billboard ad on a third-party advertiser’s site, and they’ve required us to create a VAST tag. While I’ve never done this, I brushed up on the steps to do so. Looks like I need access to Google Ad Manager, but since we don’t have AdSense as an agency, looks like this isn’t a possibility. We don’t sell ad real estate, only run campaigns and purchase it.\n\nLooks like the VAST tag itself is an XML file with html-coded parameters in it. Is this something I could easily code by hand and export for the vendor? Or is there an even simpler solution I’m not considering? Any help is appreciated, and hoping to learn from this for future endeavors. Thanks in advance!",
