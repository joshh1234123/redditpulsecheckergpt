For example:\n\n* **Technical Skills:** Is it purely deep mastery of platforms (a specific DSP/SSP, GAM, etc.), or is the differentiator broader technical expertise like SQL, Python, or data visualization for unique analysis?\n* **Soft Skills:** How much of it comes down to things like masterful negotiation, next-level client communication, or the ability to tell a compelling story with data to senior stakeholders?\n* **Strategic Thinking:** Is it an almost intuitive grasp of auction dynamics? A macro-level view of where the industry is headed and the ability to position for it? Or is it a deep understanding of a client's business that goes far beyond campaign metrics?\n* **Mindset:** Are there specific habits, frameworks for thinking, or learning processes that you've consistently seen in the top performers you've worked with?\n\nI'm not looking for a secret formula, just genuinely curious to hear different takes on this.

      "created_utc": 1757530385.0,
      "content": "Hi everyone\n\nI've been in the media buying side of things for a few years now, mostly focused on lower funnel performance with very tight and stressful targets (and with low budgets as well, max 20k a month), yet somehow I find it fun (I might be crazy), but not long ago I joined a somewhat \"large\" agency to its programmatic team and to be honest I see some things very off to me, but they seem to be \"normal\" when talking with colleagues and reading this subreddit. So I wanted to ask everyone here directly.\n\n1) How is it possible that large advertisers throw up hundreds of thousands of dolars to programmtic for the sake of reach and CTR? It seems like as long as you match the media plan targets you are a fucker and did your job. Excuse me? How do these companies don't even try to \"tie\" somehow this wasted ad spend to some measurable results? \n\nComing from a performance background I actually applied some of my old book techniques and results in the current campaigns I manage increased dramatically and everyone around seemed surprised in the agency.\n\n2) Is it normal for programmatic to just worry about CTR or am I missing something? Because what I see is that all budget coming to programmatic is just wasted with no real outcome, but somehow this is normal and everyone keeps pouring money into it??\n\n3) When it comes to campaign performance, the best optimizations by far are tweaks/changes on the actual landing pages (at least according to my exp) but here nothing of this is done and its like \"wtf, just change this or that and results will dramatically improve\". How is it that normal to just work on the campaigns in platform? That's just \"distributing\" the message, not driving real actions, those are managed if the UX in the landing page is well done.\n\n4) Why is it that programmatic is constantly focused on awareness? I get it's a top channel for that but why nobody tries to do performance (real performance) as well? Even if it cannot compete as well with social or search ads?\n\nWhen in calls with clients/colleagues it's widely accepted that in programmatic we just need to focus on spending the money and have the expected reach, cpm and CTR. And that's all to it. Like, WTF? I do believe in programmatic we can do way more than just being \"those guys that do nothing\" and to be honest it feels incredibly frustrating. \n\nThing is that when talking with way more experienced colleagues than me in programmatic I see they lack many notions to very basic performance/business logics but it doesn't bother them and bosses are happy, clients somehow are happy and everything seems to hold in this apparent fragile equilibrium.\n\nIs any of this normal? What am I missing? Is that really all to it? Again, it's a large company that manages millions in advertising budgets, but they always attribute all client revenue exclusively to social ads or search, while in programmatic we are just \"there\" spending and \"raising awareness\".\n\nOverall I feel very confused right now and not sure if I want to keep working in programmatic because of this. What am I missing? Can you people share your thoughts on this? Am I the only one? I'd really like to understand.\n\nThanks if you read everything, I needed to get this out of my chest.",

Is it creative costs, targeting, measurement, or just getting started?\n\n\t•\tMid-Market advertisers – For those spending around $250k range annually on ads, what challenges do you face with CTV? (e.g., proving ROAS, signal loss, fragmented reporting, limited tools built for mid-sized budgets, etc.)\n\n\t•\tEnterprise brands – For larger advertisers with big budgets, what are the blockers to scaling CTV as a performance channel? (e.g., attribution gaps, cross-screen measurement, walled garden dependency, cost efficiency, etc.)\n\n💰 As a quick benchmark: if you’re comfortable sharing, how much are you typically spending on CTV per year?\n\nThe goal here isn’t to pitch anything, but to collect insights from real practitioners so I can understand where Performance CTV delivers today and where it falls short.\n\nWould really appreciate your thoughts — even a couple of sentences on your biggest frustration would help a lot!\n\nThanks in advance 🙏\n",

Do they have a voice at the table in terms of allocation? Do they get to share their take on platforms? \n\nPlease note: this is not to devalue or denigrate their hard work. Speaking for myself god knows I would be up shits creek without the teams inputting campaigns and monitoring delivery and performance. I value all of them. But my leadership hardly knows their names and doesn’t blink when they leave the agency for another job as they know we’ll find the next entry level replacement. \n\nI find it insanely odd that TTD puts their traders forward in marketing materials like this. It seems totally disconnected from the reality of what I’ve seen at multiple agencies and across multiple teams at those agencies. \n\nIn any case, from one manager to all the HOKs out there, your work matters, we can’t do this without you, but it looks like if you want an existence akin to a Hindu cow TTD is your best bet because I don’t see that anywhere else.

So now I need to create a third-party tag and place that link into that tag so that everything would work great (the banner is visible, it clicks through, and clicks and viewability would be counted). \n\nI tried to solve it with ChatGPT, which provided me with a tag, and when trying it out in DV360, it seemed to work nicely. However, when looking at the stats afterwards, I see that viewability is just a bit over 0% and I get traffic from weird non-standard domains. About that problem, ChatGPT said:\n\n*\"🔹 Why your iframe script failed*\n\n* *Your tag is just “dumb JS” that injects an iframe.*\n* *It does* ***not declare any DV360 macros*** *(other than ${CLICK\\_URL} in the iframe URL).*\n* *Because of that, DV360:*\n   * *Can’t correctly map impressions/clicks to placement.*\n   * *Can’t track viewability (there’s no DV360 signal layer inside the iframe).*\n   * *Ends up serving on low-quality / “remnant” inventory → hence the weird domains & near-zero viewability.*\n\n*Basically: DV360 treated it as an unverified 3rd-party iframe, not a proper creative with tracking hooks.\"*\n\n  \nHowever, ChatGPT doesn't really give me a working script. Maybe someone has had a similar problem and knows how to solve it?\n\n\\---\n\nThe script I used was:\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> (function() { var creative = document.createElement('iframe'); creative.src = \"https://www.testbanner.com/?click=${CLICK\\_URL}\"; creative.width = \"300\"; // set your banner width creative.height = \"250\"; // set your banner height creative.frameBorder = \"0\"; creative.scrolling = \"no\"; creative.marginHeight = \"0\"; creative.marginWidth = \"0\"; document.body.appendChild(creative); })(); </script>",

We’ve been running DV360 programmatic display ads through an agency for a while now, but the results have been pretty disappointing with almost no conversions. I’m starting to think it might make sense to test Google Ads display campaigns instead, since I feel like the GDN could actually perform better in terms of driving conversions.\n\nFor those of you who’ve worked with both, how different is the inventory and performance between DV360 and Google Ads display? Is DV360 really that much more effective, or does GDN cover most of what matters anyway?\n\nThis is for an online casino brand, so I know performance can be tricky, but I’d love to hear your general take.",

But when I used YouTube Ads i know i got more reach and impressions and even did a \"Mention YouTube get $20 OFF \" deal, rarely anyone mentioned they saw us for either skip or non-skip.\n\nNow I read there is SlackAdapt which has a lot of features, does it have a lot of inventory with a lesser CPM but can reach decent premium apps or has special deals? When I initially did DV360 a lot of ads played on Tubi TV or Pluto TV like free viewing apps which I didnt like.\n\n**Does Slack Adapt have more options** to choose from vs DV360 & Amazon?\n\nIf you were me and **wanted to reach premium apps only** is there an alternative to DV360 or Amazon that you think would get me a good reach at a lower CPM, right now in DV360 im at like $25 CPM for quality apps and Amazon Private Auction im at $30.\n\nI was curious about Tatari as I saw an Ad on SharkTank, from Mr Wonderful, however i think its like $5k a week \"minimum\" required spend and the cheaper option they offer is less but is only CTV re-targeting vs linear.\n\n**Thanks for your feedback,** maybe this helps others like me know from others in the field what your take is and help guide us all.",
