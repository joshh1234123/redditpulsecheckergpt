He's promising October announcements about innovations designed to improve the digital ad ecosystem for buy-side clients.\n\n**The context:** Trade Desk reports Q3 earnings in early November. Two narratives have been dogging the company: the open web is in decline, and TTD is losing ground. Green's positioning AI as the answer to both problems.\n\n**The actual announcements:** TTD is rolling out two new AI-powered features. First is a[ tool ](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250929471947/en/The-Trade-Desk-Announces-Major-Overhaul-of-Digital-Advertising-Data-Marketplace?utm_source=beehiiv&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=u-of-digital-newsletter-10-1-25-premium&_bhlid=b7dca467d992e70868dd73a495e673d0e5d370fa)that uses machine learning to evaluate and rank audience segments across hundreds of data vendors, replacing their current pay-per-provider model with simplified pricing that could cut data costs (which currently eat up nearly a fifth of media budgets). Second is new trading modes (Koa Adaptive Trading Modes) that let buyers choose between fully automated AI optimization(called Performance Mode) or hands-on(called Control Mode) campaign management with manual bidding and allocation controls. Both launch with select agencies later this year, then wider rollout early 2026.\n\n**The pitch:** These AI innovations will \"accelerate the inevitable long-term movement toward a transparent and efficient marketplace for digital ads.\"\n\nEither this is a legitimate shift in how programmatic buying works, or it's a well-timed product launch to reshape the conversation before earnings.\n\nWe'll know more in November.",

      "content": "Integral Ad Science (IAS) is being acquired by private equity firm Novacap for $1.9 billion, taking the company private just four years after its 2021 IPO.\n\n**The deal:**\n\n* Canadian PE firm Novacap buying IAS at $10.30/share (22% premium)\n* Vista Equity Partners (majority owner since 2018) exiting completely\n* Expected to close later this year, pending regulatory approval\n\n  \n**Why this matters:**\n\nIAS and DoubleVerify basically run ad verification as a duopoly. They've already captured most of the market, but there's a massive problem: nowhere left to grow.\n\nMarketers see verification as a necessary evil and a necessary tax, not something they want to spend more on. IAS's attempts to expand into ad serving and attribution haven't moved the needle. Big platforms are building their own brand safety tools in-house, eating into market share.\n\n**The real threat: Scope3**\n\nWhile IAS dealt with Adalytics reports and government scrutiny this year, AI-first startup Scope3 has been rebuilding verification from the ground up. Founder Brian O'Kelley (former AppNexus CEO) literally posted on LinkedIn about why IAS is going private: to compete with him.\n\nHis take: Going private gives you breathing room to rebuild without quarterly earnings calls, but it's not enough. You still need to invest heavily in R&D, embrace AI/agents, and move fast. If customers start asking, \"Do I need this if I have AI?\" and your answer isn't compelling, private equity won't save you.\n\n**The bigger picture:**\n\nThis is the beginning of a pattern. Legacy adtech built on rules-based systems is entering adapt-or-die mode. AI-native competitors that are lightweight and dynamic are the future.\n\nAd verification is just the start. Which other \"mature\" adtech sectors (DSPs, SSPs, DMPs) will see this same story play out in the next 2-3 years?\n\n**My take:**   \nGoing private buys IAS time to gut the product, rebuild around AI, and make risky bets without Wall Street breathing down its neck. Expect major changes in the next 18-24 months. The question is whether it'll be enough.\n\nWhat do you think? Can legacy adtech companies successfully reinvent themselves? ",

Only about 10,000 on the list.  The list is my perfect local avatar. Vibe thinks they can match about 50% to 60% of my list. \n\nI would be the “star” of the ad. 😂\n\nBut I would also do direct mail to the same list that vibe was able to match. Basically the same messaging from the video ad. \n\nNow - the biggest issue, which I don’t think is an issue personally, is that I may not be able to utilize all of the $50 daily spend because of list size. I’m okay with that because of how targeted it is. \n\nAnd I plan on doing direct mail to the rest of the list that wasn’t matched in Vibe as a test to see if Vibe is having an impact on response rates from the direct mail. I am fairly positive the vibe ads will increase response rates from the direct mail. \n\nUpdate Edit: They can't tell me who they matched and who they did not. So, I would need to mail everyone on the list and hope that the ads increase the response rates on the direct mail as I am not expecting much response from the ads themselves. \n\n",

Sat through the demos, got the rep assigned, whole nine yards.\n\nFirst thing I noticed - it's literally TTD. Like the interface is TTD, the documentation is ttd, even the fucking URL structure is TTD. which cool, at least I'm not learning a completely new platform.\n\nThe audience targeting based on actual purchase behavior is legit. We can see what someone bought at Walmart and target them accordingly. The closed-loop attribution shows real incremental lift, not the usual \"last click gets all the credit\" bullshit.\n\nTrying to compare performance against our other TTD campaigns though? nightmare. The reporting doesn't quite line up. Walmart Connect has its own dashboard that shows retail-specific metrics but then you've got your TTD dashboard showing different numbers. reconciling what happened in-store vs online vs offsite is just spreadsheet hell.\n\nAlso the account management is completely separate from TTD. Different reps, different SLAs, different response times. same tech stack but you're managing two completely different relationships.\n\noh and if your client does business with Walmart already? Good fucking luck separating out the retail media performance from everything else they've got going on with them. their sales team doesn't talk to the Connect team apparently.\n\nWas it worth it? Yeah honestly, the attribution alone justifies it if you've got clients selling through Walmart. but anyone telling you it's seamless because it's TTD under the hood is full of shit.\n\nAnyone else running Walmart Connect alongside regular TTD? how are you handling the reporting situation?",

I have around 5 years of exp between programmatic and ppc. It's a work I enjoy and have fun with (but not to be underpaid, or at least its how I feel like) and why not saying it, I'm good at.\n\nMy questions for you, how do you see currently the job market on the programmatic end in europe? What salaries in northern/nordics countries are average for somebody of my experience on average? Any advice or tips when doing this job switch? I'd like to still work in programmatic, but again, I have experience on full funnel media buying.\n\nI dont mind at all taking more responsibilities, I just want to get properly paid for it.\n\nJust another guy trying to make his way in the galaxy as Jango Fett would say.\n\nThanks everyone, if you have questions for me or need more context, I'll happy provide.

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently joined one of the Big 6 agencies after working at a small independent agency for about a year and a half. I’ve been in programmatic for roughly that same amount of time, and I really enjoy the work overall.\n\nSince starting here in September, though, I’ve noticed the pace is *insanely* fast. It often feels like we’re constantly chasing deadlines, always short-staffed, and everyone seems to be complaining about something. I know it’s part of the agency world, but sometimes it feels like we’re just firefighting all day.\n\nAnother thing I’ve noticed is that sometimes we’re asked to push certain products or “friendly” publishers due to internal agreements, which can make me feel a bit powerless or limited in doing what’s *actually* best for performance. I’m curious — for those of you working in big network agencies, especially in Europe, do you experience the same kind of politics or “preferred partner” pressure?\n\nAs for salary, I’m earning more than I did before, but from what I’ve heard, it’s still not particularly high compared to other roles in media. My plan is to treat this as a learning experience — kind of a training ground to grow my skills and hopefully progress in my career.\n\nWould love to hear if anyone else has gone through something similar or has advice on how to make the most out of this kind of environment.\n\nThanks!",

When I use the forecasting tool and target only that municipality, only a fraction of those people are in the city the data says they should be. I tried running a campaign to see if was just a glitch with these previewing tools, but the results have been a slow trickle which indicates to me that the large majority people who are on my list are not getting targeted.\n\nAny idea what is going wrong?

It’s designed to let marketers plan campaigns, create branded content, and launch ads, all without going through an agency.\n\nAccording to their announcement, Open Pro has three parts:\n\n* Plan: Use AI trained on WPP’s data to build campaign strategies and audience insights.\n* Create: Auto-generate brand-safe creative using tools like Google’s Veo, OpenAI’s Sora, and Adobe Firefly \n* Publish: Either push content straight to ad platforms or route through WPP’s Open Media Studio.\n\nPricing is usage-based after an initial access fee, so it’s structured more like a software platform than an agency engagement.\n\n  \nWhen WPP hired Cindy Rose from Microsoft earlier this year, it signaled a shift from services to platforms. Rose helped lead Microsoft’s transition from a product company to a full-fledged platform business, and it seems she’s now trying to apply the same strategy at WPP.\n\nWPP Open is starting to look like Salesforce for advertising:\n\n* Smaller brands and in-house teams can pay for access to WPP’s AI tools.\n* Agencies might license their data clean room or creative automation features.\n* WPP stops competing for smaller clients and starts extracting value from the entire ad supply chain.\n\nThis could mark a major turning point for holding companies. Instead of acting as service providers, they’re evolving into infrastructure that others in the industry depend on.\n\nIn some ways, it’s a new approach, but also a familiar one. We’ve seen similar attempts before, back when trading desks first appeared in the early 2010s.\n\nSo I’ve got a few questions:  \n\\- Could WPP really pull off a Microsoft-style transformation?  \n\\- Will it eat into the potential income of smaller independent agencies?",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m running a campaign in DV360 and seeing something that doesn’t quite make sense.  \nThere’s a very high number of post-view conversions and almost no post-click conversions, even though the gclid is being passed correctly — I’ve tested it manually and the click-based conversions register fine.\n\nCTR is quite low across all line items, but what really confuses me is that the best-performing creatives are retargeting ones — shown only to users who already added a product to their cart. These ads include discounts of up to 60% that can only be accessed through the ad URL.\n\nAs a user, I would normally click an ad like that (if only to not lose the discount URL), so it’s odd to see people supposedly converting without clicking.\n\nI was looking at the “Time To Conversion” metric to get a sense of the delay between the impression and the conversion, but the UI doesn’t specify any units — I can’t tell if it’s in days, hours, or something else, and the documentation isn’t clear either.\n\nHas anyone experienced similar behavior? Is this kind of post-view inflation normal for DV360 retargeting?  \nAlso, what’s the best way to confirm that the impressions truly come from DV360 and not from another channel that might be firing the same Floodlight tag?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights.\n\n\n\n",

I imagine that for DV360, it could be that theres not much difference between baseball and hockey fans. \n\nCPA in MLB campaign was great until the day after the Stanley Cup was over. subscriptions idried up the day after - and for the next 3 months I could not make the campaign perform. Tactics that worked well while hockey was on, had a 10x increase in CPA. \n\nIn my opinion, the volume of Hockey-skewed data messed up the bidder in the Baseball campaign since: \n\n* large volume hockey visitors converted and got attributed to baseball campaign via retargeting/broad sports targeting \n\n* algos/bidder kept intaking audience and placement signals that worked while Hockey was on and trying to find users similar to those that converted in April-May. \n\n\n\nSo, my questions are: \n\n* how do you think i can go about minimizing cross attribution given that the client wont build separate landing pages per sport and 90% of conversions are post-view\n\n* how do you feel about my theory of feeding wrong data signals to the bidder for 3 months, which made it basically impossible to recover and find a new audience (baseball audience) after? \n\n\nCurious to hear your answers!

      "content": "In some ways, Amazon is playing a dirty but brilliant game.\n\nOn one side, Amazon’s offering agencies free head-to-head tests pitting its DSP directly against competitors like The Trade Desk, literally covering all costs (inventory, tech, measurement, etc.) for 4–6 week campaigns.\n\nIt’s an aggressive move to prove Amazon’s DSP outperforms others. The Trade Desk’s CMO Ian Colley called the tests “unfair,” arguing that Amazon performs well mainly because it directs spend toward its own properties rather than the open web.\n\nBut on the other side of the battlefield, AWS is getting defensive.  \nAs Google Cloud has been offering incentives and compute credits to lure ad tech companies over, AWS risked losing one of its most data-heavy verticals.\n\nNow it’s countering with RTB Fabric, a new real-time bidding infrastructure built inside AWS.\n\nIf two partners are on AWS within the same data center, they can communicate in microseconds instead of milliseconds, drastically cutting latency and networking costs (reportedly by up to 80%).\n\nThis aligns with AWS’s broader philosophy of “plug-and-play” openness, modularity, decentralization, and interoperability.\n\nRTB Fabric isn’t an open marketplace by itself but it fits right into that infrastructure mindset, giving ad tech firms more flexibility and control than Google’s more closed, vertically integrated ecosystem.\n\nThat last point matters.  \nGoogle is no longer seen as a “safe” infrastructure partner, not just because of competition, but due to mounting antitrust scrutiny. Many ad tech firms are understandably hesitant to run their operations on the same stack owned by a company being investigated for ad market dominance.\n\nAWS, by contrast, can credibly present itself as a more neutral infrastructure provider. even if everyone knows Amazon has its own motives.\n\nAnd there’s another layer:  \nas AI takes over ad tech, infrastructure needs will explode. The compute, data processing, and real-time modeling required for AI-driven ad optimization all funnel directly into AWS’s core business. That’s a built-in growth opportunity:  every AI advancement in ad tech drives more demand for AWS infrastructure.\n\nSo wdyt, is Amazon playing this right?",
