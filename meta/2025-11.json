      "content": "I’m curious to hear others’ experiences with what types of media ads have worked best for local businesses.\n\nI own a small IT services company and have been experimenting with different DSPs and platforms to see what actually moves the needle. So far, I’ve had the best response through **Amazon DSP** and **DV360**, running campaigns between **6–11pm**. I even got tagged in a few local Facebook groups where residents mentioned seeing my streaming TV ad which was great to see. Honestly, I think I might be one of the only small businesses in my area (or maybe even the state) doing any kind of programmatic advertising.\n\nI’ve also tested **DOOH**, including **in-theater ads** (about 20 theaters for two weeks — zero response), **screens in gyms, grocery stores, and retail** (also zero), and **digital billboards** via **Admatx (The Trade Desk)** targeting two local Lamar signs. The signs were impossible to miss — one-lane each way, 40mph road — but after a month (5pm–7pm rotation), I saw no measurable response.\n\n**YouTube Instant Guaranteed** got plenty of views but no noticeable leads. \n\nI also ran an **audio campaign** on Admatx across multiple platforms for two weeks, again zero response.\n\nAt this point, it really seems like **streaming TV** is the clear winner for local brand recognition. People notice it, comment on it, and we get actual leads from it. Sure, I could keep testing DOOH or audio for a few more months, but if one channel is delivering consistent awareness and results, it makes sense to double down there.\n\nThat said, I’m really curious, for those who work with **local businesses**, what ad types or strategies have you found to be most effective in generating real leads/sales?\n\nHappy to share more about all the tools and DSPs I’ve used if anyone’s interested.

YouTube’s growing subscription business also plays a key role, with a new senior leader set to oversee the unit.\n\nAI’s promise to transform how we work is no longer theoretical; it’s unfolding in real time across major tech companies.

I have recently found myself in a company that has 0 understanding of programmatic and only do direct deals for their gambling affiliated display content. As part of my new remit they want me to prove the value of programmatic by capitalising on around 270 million unfilled impressions worldwide. \n\nI have been able to set up an ad server / SSP (GAM), implemented some fairly standard ad sizes, mobile banner, top leaderboard, MPU's etc and have also implemented some KVP's for ATF/BTF and ad placement. However the fill rate currently is still very low around 5% with a £0.90 floor price. As I have never really worked in optimising delivery, I am asking if anyone has some helpful advice that could aid in filling the inventory space more consistently (was hoping for 50-60%)? I have a vague understanding of yield groups and could potentially look at utilising other SSP's to open up to more advertising traffic. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated for a newbie in this space!",
