      "content": "I’m curious to hear others’ experiences with what types of media ads have worked best for local businesses.\n\nI own a small IT services company and have been experimenting with different DSPs and platforms to see what actually moves the needle. So far, I’ve had the best response through **Amazon DSP** and **DV360**, running campaigns between **6–11pm**. I even got tagged in a few local Facebook groups where residents mentioned seeing my streaming TV ad which was great to see. Honestly, I think I might be one of the only small businesses in my area (or maybe even the state) doing any kind of programmatic advertising.\n\nI’ve also tested **DOOH**, including **in-theater ads** (about 20 theaters for two weeks — zero response), **screens in gyms, grocery stores, and retail** (also zero), and **digital billboards** via **Admatx (The Trade Desk)** targeting two local Lamar signs. The signs were impossible to miss — one-lane each way, 40mph road — but after a month (5pm–7pm rotation), I saw no measurable response.\n\n**YouTube Instant Guaranteed** got plenty of views but no noticeable leads. \n\nI also ran an **audio campaign** on Admatx across multiple platforms for two weeks, again zero response.\n\nAt this point, it really seems like **streaming TV** is the clear winner for local brand recognition. People notice it, comment on it, and we get actual leads from it. Sure, I could keep testing DOOH or audio for a few more months, but if one channel is delivering consistent awareness and results, it makes sense to double down there.\n\nThat said, I’m really curious, for those who work with **local businesses**, what ad types or strategies have you found to be most effective in generating real leads/sales?\n\nHappy to share more about all the tools and DSPs I’ve used if anyone’s interested.

I have recently found myself in a company that has 0 understanding of programmatic and only do direct deals for their gambling affiliated display content. As part of my new remit they want me to prove the value of programmatic by capitalising on around 270 million unfilled impressions worldwide. \n\nI have been able to set up an ad server / SSP (GAM), implemented some fairly standard ad sizes, mobile banner, top leaderboard, MPU's etc and have also implemented some KVP's for ATF/BTF and ad placement. However the fill rate currently is still very low around 5% with a £0.90 floor price. As I have never really worked in optimising delivery, I am asking if anyone has some helpful advice that could aid in filling the inventory space more consistently (was hoping for 50-60%)? I have a vague understanding of yield groups and could potentially look at utilising other SSP's to open up to more advertising traffic. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated for a newbie in this space!",

When looking at the troubleshooter, it looks like nearly all of our bid responses are  either bidding below the floor (even though we're running on open exchange?), losing the internal auction or losing the external auction. \n\n\n\nWe don't have set CPM goals and can afford to bid higher if that will help, but we're using DV360s automated bidding optimizer that decides where and how much to bid. I'm not sure if running a fixed bid would be beneficial as we'd like a more dynamic bid tailored to performance. What's also frustrating though is we're not winning the best inventory. For pre-roll video our avg. CPM is less than $3 when previously we've typically seen pre-roll CPMs closer to $10-$15. So we're losing bids, and the ones we are winning are not great inventory.\n\n  \nHas anyone run in to a similar issue in DV360 and found something that works for you? Is fixed bid the only way to go? If so, how much do you usually bid? DV360 used to have a bid multiplier but it looks like it no longer has that feature.",

I can basically work whenever I want as long as I attend my meetings. The workload isn’t bad, and I have a lot of free time for myself.\n\nRecently, I applied to a few new jobs just to see what’s out there, and I got an offer for an in house position that requires going into the office 4 days a week. I’m trying to negotiate it down to 3 days. The offer comes with a $10k salary increase, but the team is extremely small, a bit disorganized, and I’d have to wear many hats. The office is about a 30 minute drive with no traffic.\n\nHonestly, I don’t think I’m going to accept it, what do you guys think?\n",

Here a summary.\n\nBeen in the programmatic game since late 2000s and have experience across various aspects of the industry; ad network, DSP, DMP/identity, agency, client side x2, retail media.\n\nCareer growth was going well, in the early 2010s (thank you VC money and a supportive manager), but after a couple of career hiccups (redundancy and manager fallout), my salary peaked around 2023 but redundancy ended in 2024. \n\nSince then I took a 15% pay cut to get back in the market but the role took a turn for the worst and I left. Despite being a role somewhat unfamiliar to me, yet performing well, I love where I’m at present but it comes with a further 10% paycut. Effectively I’m on the same salary as I was back 2013 but now with family, mortgage, inflation it feels a lot worse. \n\nThe job market looks tough at the moment. I’m too long out of the game for hands-on-keyboard trading experience, and I’m not convinced agency sales is for me (I’m too old and don’t have the day to day media buyer network tech companies are seeking). \n\nI don’t have the senior commercial experience of running a P&L or man management experience for that matter as typically I’ve operated as a IC for the most part. That said I know I have good partnership experience and having some retail experience (both client and tech) feels like a good fit. But no idea where to start. ",

I really want to keep upskilling on the programmatic side, but I’m not totally sure *how* to frame that ask at work or what areas I should be pushing to get more exposure to.\n\nI saw a post here the other day, advertising a job, that mentioned skill areas like:\n\n* Supply path optimization\n* Deal negotiation\n* Campaign planning + activation\n* Pulling insights from campaign data\n* Bid optimization / bid factoring\n* Understanding the biddable/RTB ecosystem\n* Knowing how DSPs, SSPs, and publishers actually work together\n* Navigating supply paths + Deal ID structures (PMP, PG, PH)\n\n\n\nThat list helped me get more specific details/framing about what I’d like to learn, and I’ve already had a conversation with my team about wanting to grow in programmatic — but I’m sure there are other gaps that aren't mentioned above, and that I’m not thinking about.\n\n\n\nSo for anyone working in programmatic at a more senior level:\n\n* What other skills, responsibilities, or technical foundations should I be aiming for?\n* Are there things you wish more mid-level traders/strategists understood earlier in their careers?\n* And how would you phrase this kind of development request so it doesn’t just sound like “hey I wanna learn more,” but actually shows intent and direction?\n\n\n\nAny input would be super appreciated 🙏 ",

Como proprietário de uma MCM (Multiple Customer Management) no Google Ad Manager, tenho visto de perto o impacto que a migração para uma estrutura de gerenciamento profissional pode ter na receita dos parceiros.\n\nRecentemente, abri algumas vagas e estou liberando convites para novos parceiros que queiram otimizar seus ganhos. A migração para uma MCM bem gerenciada oferece vantagens significativas que vão além do AdSense/AdX convencional.\n\nO que você pode esperar ao migrar para a nossa MCM?\n\n•Aumento real nos eCPMs: Com a nossa otimização e o poder de negociação da MCM, o Ad Exchange compete de forma mais agressiva pelo seu inventário, elevando os preços.\n\n•Melhora na taxa de preenchimento: Conseguimos um preenchimento mais forte, especialmente em tráfego de países de Nível 2 e 3.\n\n•Acesso a otimizações avançadas: Você terá acesso a regras de piso (floor rules) mais eficazes e outras ferramentas de otimização dentro do GAM.\n\n•Pagamentos simplificados e previsíveis: Centralizamos os pagamentos para que você tenha mais previsibilidade e organização financeira.\n\n•Redução de latência: Eliminamos atrasos e ruídos causados por redes de terceiros, melhorando a experiência do usuário.\n\nA ideia é simples: usar a estrutura da minha MCM para que você também possa alcançar um novo patamar de receita, sem precisar de grandes alterações no seu site.\n\nSe você tem interesse em migrar e quer aproveitar um desses convites, ou simplesmente deseja trocar uma ideia sobre otimização de eCPMs, AdX, regras de precificação e estratégias de monetização, estou à disposição.\n\nMeu WhatsApp: +55 62 99811-88100",

      "content": "We already saw this in other marketing areas... where you have to know and do everything :) Now they call this role Data Governance.  \n  \n**What does a successful Director look like?** \n\nWe don’t all look the same, and we don’t expect you to, either. But successful members of our team generally have a passion for emerging tech and media, bring a data-driven approach to decision-making, have a problem solving mind, have a fresh perspective and share it in a positive way, don’t shy away from a challenge, and are always hungry to learn more. \n\nWe look for prior experience in media analytics, especially digital media. You should already be used to representing your team to clients, since Directors are often the face of our Data Governance & Analytics team. We hope you’re a numbers whiz and know how to bring data to life. We’re also hoping you have at least two years of experience managing junior-level staff members and have at least seven years of prior professional experience. \n\n**Responsibilities**\n\n**What does a Data Governance Director do day-to-day?** \n\nOur Directors work very closely with their team of analysts to help them stay on track with day-to-day deliverables. They also contribute crucial intellectual capital to their teams by designing and implementing standardized processes and protocols to enable efficient data management; they also behave like Business Analysts who understand client requirements and are able to produce clear documentation to facilitate automation of data processing. Directors also work closely with their VP to formulate a vision for their accounts and the department, and then execute on that vision with their team of analysts. As such, Directors are mentors, managers, project managers, and thought leaders, all at the same time.\n\n**Qualifications**\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n* 6+ years of work experience in media or related field\n* 3+ years in a managerial or supervisory role.\n* Bachelor’s degree. Degree in a related field is a plus (i.e. STEM, Economics, Marketing, MIS, BI, etc.).\n* Ability to communicate complex ideas to both external and internal clients, and ability and comfort with presenting to senior level clients.\n* Ability to develop frameworks, manage challenges and steer complex projects.\n* Extensive experience with Digital Media channels and knowledge of Offline Media channels\n* Extensive experience with Ad Servers such as Google Campaign Manager, Social media platforms and website analytics tools such as Google Analytics.\n* Experience with Media Planning and Buying platforms such as Media Tools and Media Ocean.\n* Experience with other digital media and analytics tools such, Measurement Vendors and BI Software.\n* Understanding of Media Taxonomy.\n* Advanced Excel skills (ability to work with macros, advanced formulas, pivot tables) and experience working with large data sets.\n* Experience managing and querying relational databases.\n* Understanding of a broad range of online advertising media channels such as Search, Display Banners, Email, Contextual, and Social, as well as subject matter expertise in at least one of these areas.\n* World-class customer service skills. Ability to service clients, partners and internal stakeholders by understanding their needs, translating those needs into creative solutions, and delivering on those solutions with diligence and a sense of urgency.\n\n**Preferred Experience:**\n\n* Experience with ad verification tools such as IAS, Moat, etc.\n* Experience with using or analyzing data form DMPs and DSPs.\n* Experience and understanding with various cloud computing environments: AWS, Azure, GCP.\n* Knowledge of Python or other data manipulation languages.\n* Experience designing databases, schemas, and ETL.\n* Experience with third party research partners such as GfK, Nielsen and comScore.\n\n[https://careers.publicisgroupe.com/zenith/jobs/127951?lang=en-us&previousLocale=en-US](https://careers.publicisgroupe.com/zenith/jobs/127951?lang=en-us&previousLocale=en-US)",
