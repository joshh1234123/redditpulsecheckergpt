Though I work on the ad-ops side of the business, I'm curious and interested to work more on the technical side, and I believe this is my best opportunity.\n\nI'm looking for any advice from the people who have been on the technical side of things to help me understand: \n1) what would your day to day look like.\n2) what are the things that an interviewer would expect me to know about.\n3) I have my website with me. So I wonder how I can start working on implementing this website with oRTB and other SSPs (PubMatic, BidSwitch, Appnexus, Rubicon, Pulsepoint, Freewheel). \n4) I assume integrations are most commonly done by the developers, if that's the case, what this role expects me to do. I've searched a lot, but I haven't been able to wrap my head around the end to end approach that someone in the integration role would do. \n\nAny help would do wonders!\n\n\nDescription:\n•Own supply integrations via Header Bidding, ORTB protocol, and RTB/PMP. • Lead SSP onboarding, managing endpoints, tags, and feeds with accuracy. \n• Manage DSP onboarding, ensuring compatibility and smooth daily operations (PubMatic, BidSwitch, etc.).\n• Oversee end-to-end ad operations and publisher account management across CTV, Video, Display, and In-App.\n• Audit publisher integrations to ensure data integrity, fraud detection, fill rates, and error resolution.\n\nThanks for your time:)",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m running a campaign in DV360 and seeing something that doesn’t quite make sense.  \nThere’s a very high number of post-view conversions and almost no post-click conversions, even though the gclid is being passed correctly — I’ve tested it manually and the click-based conversions register fine.\n\nCTR is quite low across all line items, but what really confuses me is that the best-performing creatives are retargeting ones — shown only to users who already added a product to their cart. These ads include discounts of up to 60% that can only be accessed through the ad URL.\n\nAs a user, I would normally click an ad like that (if only to not lose the discount URL), so it’s odd to see people supposedly converting without clicking.\n\nI was looking at the “Time To Conversion” metric to get a sense of the delay between the impression and the conversion, but the UI doesn’t specify any units — I can’t tell if it’s in days, hours, or something else, and the documentation isn’t clear either.\n\nHas anyone experienced similar behavior? Is this kind of post-view inflation normal for DV360 retargeting?  \nAlso, what’s the best way to confirm that the impressions truly come from DV360 and not from another channel that might be firing the same Floodlight tag?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights.\n\n\n\n",

I imagine that for DV360, it could be that theres not much difference between baseball and hockey fans. \n\nCPA in MLB campaign was great until the day after the Stanley Cup was over. subscriptions idried up the day after - and for the next 3 months I could not make the campaign perform. Tactics that worked well while hockey was on, had a 10x increase in CPA. \n\nIn my opinion, the volume of Hockey-skewed data messed up the bidder in the Baseball campaign since: \n\n* large volume hockey visitors converted and got attributed to baseball campaign via retargeting/broad sports targeting \n\n* algos/bidder kept intaking audience and placement signals that worked while Hockey was on and trying to find users similar to those that converted in April-May. \n\n\n\nSo, my questions are: \n\n* how do you think i can go about minimizing cross attribution given that the client wont build separate landing pages per sport and 90% of conversions are post-view\n\n* how do you feel about my theory of feeding wrong data signals to the bidder for 3 months, which made it basically impossible to recover and find a new audience (baseball audience) after? \n\n\nCurious to hear your answers!

      "content": "In some ways, Amazon is playing a dirty but brilliant game.\n\nOn one side, Amazon’s offering agencies free head-to-head tests pitting its DSP directly against competitors like The Trade Desk, literally covering all costs (inventory, tech, measurement, etc.) for 4–6 week campaigns.\n\nIt’s an aggressive move to prove Amazon’s DSP outperforms others. The Trade Desk’s CMO Ian Colley called the tests “unfair,” arguing that Amazon performs well mainly because it directs spend toward its own properties rather than the open web.\n\nBut on the other side of the battlefield, AWS is getting defensive.  \nAs Google Cloud has been offering incentives and compute credits to lure ad tech companies over, AWS risked losing one of its most data-heavy verticals.\n\nNow it’s countering with RTB Fabric, a new real-time bidding infrastructure built inside AWS.\n\nIf two partners are on AWS within the same data center, they can communicate in microseconds instead of milliseconds, drastically cutting latency and networking costs (reportedly by up to 80%).\n\nThis aligns with AWS’s broader philosophy of “plug-and-play” openness, modularity, decentralization, and interoperability.\n\nRTB Fabric isn’t an open marketplace by itself but it fits right into that infrastructure mindset, giving ad tech firms more flexibility and control than Google’s more closed, vertically integrated ecosystem.\n\nThat last point matters.  \nGoogle is no longer seen as a “safe” infrastructure partner, not just because of competition, but due to mounting antitrust scrutiny. Many ad tech firms are understandably hesitant to run their operations on the same stack owned by a company being investigated for ad market dominance.\n\nAWS, by contrast, can credibly present itself as a more neutral infrastructure provider. even if everyone knows Amazon has its own motives.\n\nAnd there’s another layer:  \nas AI takes over ad tech, infrastructure needs will explode. The compute, data processing, and real-time modeling required for AI-driven ad optimization all funnel directly into AWS’s core business. That’s a built-in growth opportunity:  every AI advancement in ad tech drives more demand for AWS infrastructure.\n\nSo wdyt, is Amazon playing this right?",

      "content": "I’m curious to hear others’ experiences with what types of media ads have worked best for local businesses.\n\nI own a small IT services company and have been experimenting with different DSPs and platforms to see what actually moves the needle. So far, I’ve had the best response through **Amazon DSP** and **DV360**, running campaigns between **6–11pm**. I even got tagged in a few local Facebook groups where residents mentioned seeing my streaming TV ad which was great to see. Honestly, I think I might be one of the only small businesses in my area (or maybe even the state) doing any kind of programmatic advertising.\n\nI’ve also tested **DOOH**, including **in-theater ads** (about 20 theaters for two weeks — zero response), **screens in gyms, grocery stores, and retail** (also zero), and **digital billboards** via **Admatx (The Trade Desk)** targeting two local Lamar signs. The signs were impossible to miss — one-lane each way, 40mph road — but after a month (5pm–7pm rotation), I saw no measurable response.\n\n**YouTube Instant Guaranteed** got plenty of views but no noticeable leads. \n\nI also ran an **audio campaign** on Admatx across multiple platforms for two weeks, again zero response.\n\nAt this point, it really seems like **streaming TV** is the clear winner for local brand recognition. People notice it, comment on it, and we get actual leads from it. Sure, I could keep testing DOOH or audio for a few more months, but if one channel is delivering consistent awareness and results, it makes sense to double down there.\n\nThat said, I’m really curious, for those who work with **local businesses**, what ad types or strategies have you found to be most effective in generating real leads/sales?\n\nHappy to share more about all the tools and DSPs I’ve used if anyone’s interested.

I have recently found myself in a company that has 0 understanding of programmatic and only do direct deals for their gambling affiliated display content. As part of my new remit they want me to prove the value of programmatic by capitalising on around 270 million unfilled impressions worldwide. \n\nI have been able to set up an ad server / SSP (GAM), implemented some fairly standard ad sizes, mobile banner, top leaderboard, MPU's etc and have also implemented some KVP's for ATF/BTF and ad placement. However the fill rate currently is still very low around 5% with a £0.90 floor price. As I have never really worked in optimising delivery, I am asking if anyone has some helpful advice that could aid in filling the inventory space more consistently (was hoping for 50-60%)? I have a vague understanding of yield groups and could potentially look at utilising other SSP's to open up to more advertising traffic. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated for a newbie in this space!",

I'm not sure if running a fixed bid would be beneficial as we'd like a more dynamic bid tailored to performance. What's also frustrating though is we're not winning the best inventory. For pre-roll video our avg. CPM is less than $3 when previously we've typically seen pre-roll CPMs closer to $10-$15. So we're losing bids, and the ones we are winning are not great inventory.\n\n  \nHas anyone run in to a similar issue in DV360 and found something that works for you? Is fixed bid the only way to go? If so, how much do you usually bid? DV360 used to have a bid multiplier but it looks like it no longer has that feature.",

I have an interview scheduled next week that requires knowledge of DV360, but I am currently experienced only in publisher side campaign management. I currently don’t have the budget to buy any paid courses or materials... Things are a bit tight right now, so I’m trying to make the best use of free resources... I tried searching for it on YouTube but there is very minimal knowledge available there on the tool.\n\nIf anyone here has any DV360 study material, notes, or personal summaries that you’ve created and can share, I’d be really, really grateful... It would mean a lot and help me prepare better for this opportunity...\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who can help...\n\n",

Despite being a role somewhat unfamiliar to me, yet performing well, I love where I’m at present but it comes with a further 10% paycut. Effectively I’m on the same salary as I was back 2013 but now with family, mortgage, inflation it feels a lot worse. \n\nThe job market looks tough at the moment. I’m too long out of the game for hands-on-keyboard trading experience, and I’m not convinced agency sales is for me (I’m too old and don’t have the day to day media buyer network tech companies are seeking). \n\nI don’t have the senior commercial experience of running a P&L or man management experience for that matter as typically I’ve operated as a IC for the most part. That said I know I have good partnership experience and having some retail experience (both client and tech) feels like a good fit. But no idea where to start. ",

      "content": "Hey folks, looking for some advice from people deeper in the programmatic space. \n\nQuick background: I’ve got about 4 years’ experience in paid media (mostly across social + Google), and around a year in helping out on executional things in programmatic (mainly setting up Demand Gen, Video and Display IOs,LIs and ads in CM360 + DV360, when I'm given an outline of what is needed). I really want to keep upskilling on the programmatic side, but I’m not totally sure *how* to frame that ask at work or what areas I should be pushing to get more exposure to.\n\nI saw a post here the other day, advertising a job, that mentioned skill areas like:\n\n* Supply path optimization\n* Deal negotiation\n* Campaign planning + activation\n* Pulling insights from campaign data\n* Bid optimization / bid factoring\n* Understanding the biddable/RTB ecosystem\n* Knowing how DSPs, SSPs, and publishers actually work together\n* Navigating supply paths + Deal ID structures (PMP, PG, PH)\n\n\n\nThat list helped me get more specific details/framing about what I’d like to learn, and I’ve already had a conversation with my team about wanting to grow in programmatic — but I’m sure there are other gaps that aren't mentioned above, and that I’m not thinking about.\n\n\n\nSo for anyone working in programmatic at a more senior level:\n\n* What other skills, responsibilities, or technical foundations should I be aiming for?\n* Are there things you wish more mid-level traders/strategists understood earlier in their careers?\n* And how would you phrase this kind of development request so it doesn’t just sound like “hey I wanna learn more,” but actually shows intent and direction?\n\n\n\nAny input would be super appreciated 🙏 ",
