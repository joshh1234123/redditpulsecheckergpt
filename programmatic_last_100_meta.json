      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI recently joined one of the Big 6 agencies after working at a small independent agency for about a year and a half. I’ve been in programmatic for roughly that same amount of time, and I really enjoy the work overall.\n\nSince starting here in September, though, I’ve noticed the pace is *insanely* fast. It often feels like we’re constantly chasing deadlines, always short-staffed, and everyone seems to be complaining about something. I know it’s part of the agency world, but sometimes it feels like we’re just firefighting all day.\n\nAnother thing I’ve noticed is that sometimes we’re asked to push certain products or “friendly” publishers due to internal agreements, which can make me feel a bit powerless or limited in doing what’s *actually* best for performance. I’m curious — for those of you working in big network agencies, especially in Europe, do you experience the same kind of politics or “preferred partner” pressure?\n\nAs for salary, I’m earning more than I did before, but from what I’ve heard, it’s still not particularly high compared to other roles in media. My plan is to treat this as a learning experience — kind of a training ground to grow my skills and hopefully progress in my career.\n\nWould love to hear if anyone else has gone through something similar or has advice on how to make the most out of this kind of environment.\n\nThanks!",

This has been reliable data in both other ad platforms like Meta as well as off-line.\n\nWhen I upload to Stackadapt, however, it shows people as being all over the country (and the world) to an extent that VPNs or people moving can't explain. Only about half of the matched audience is showing as actually in the state of MN, let alone the municipality I'm interested in. When I use the forecasting tool and target only that municipality, only a fraction of those people are in the city the data says they should be. I tried running a campaign to see if was just a glitch with these previewing tools, but the results have been a slow trickle which indicates to me that the large majority people who are on my list are not getting targeted.\n\nAny idea what is going wrong? I've double checked the file requirements, compared my uploaded list to the data in NGPVAN to see if things somehow got jumbled, made sure my bids are competitive, but no luck so far.\n\n[Stackadapt's geo placements for my all-MN audience.](https://preview.redd.it/zp4cjrsulwwf1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=10628c97c7948fd1011c60a2bf55d641ad7ba595)\n\n",

It’s designed to let marketers plan campaigns, create branded content, and launch ads, all without going through an agency.\n\nAccording to their announcement, Open Pro has three parts:\n\n* Plan: Use AI trained on WPP’s data to build campaign strategies and audience insights.\n* Create: Auto-generate brand-safe creative using tools like Google’s Veo, OpenAI’s Sora, and Adobe Firefly \n* Publish: Either push content straight to ad platforms or route through WPP’s Open Media Studio.\n\nPricing is usage-based after an initial access fee, so it’s structured more like a software platform than an agency engagement.\n\n  \nWhen WPP hired Cindy Rose from Microsoft earlier this year, it signaled a shift from services to platforms. Rose helped lead Microsoft’s transition from a product company to a full-fledged platform business, and it seems she’s now trying to apply the same strategy at WPP.\n\nWPP Open is starting to look like Salesforce for advertising:\n\n* Smaller brands and in-house teams can pay for access to WPP’s AI tools.\n* Agencies might license their data clean room or creative automation features.\n* WPP stops competing for smaller clients and starts extracting value from the entire ad supply chain.\n\nThis could mark a major turning point for holding companies. Instead of acting as service providers, they’re evolving into infrastructure that others in the industry depend on.\n\nIn some ways, it’s a new approach, but also a familiar one. We’ve seen similar attempts before, back when trading desks first appeared in the early 2010s.\n\nSo I’ve got a few questions:  \n\\- Could WPP really pull off a Microsoft-style transformation?  \n\\- Will it eat into the potential income of smaller independent agencies?",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m running a campaign in DV360 and seeing something that doesn’t quite make sense.  \nThere’s a very high number of post-view conversions and almost no post-click conversions, even though the gclid is being passed correctly — I’ve tested it manually and the click-based conversions register fine.\n\nCTR is quite low across all line items, but what really confuses me is that the best-performing creatives are retargeting ones — shown only to users who already added a product to their cart. These ads include discounts of up to 60% that can only be accessed through the ad URL.\n\nAs a user, I would normally click an ad like that (if only to not lose the discount URL), so it’s odd to see people supposedly converting without clicking.\n\nI was looking at the “Time To Conversion” metric to get a sense of the delay between the impression and the conversion, but the UI doesn’t specify any units — I can’t tell if it’s in days, hours, or something else, and the documentation isn’t clear either.\n\nHas anyone experienced similar behavior? Is this kind of post-view inflation normal for DV360 retargeting?  \nAlso, what’s the best way to confirm that the impressions truly come from DV360 and not from another channel that might be firing the same Floodlight tag?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights.\n\n\n\n",

I imagine that for DV360, it could be that theres not much difference between baseball and hockey fans. \n\nCPA in MLB campaign was great until the day after the Stanley Cup was over. subscriptions idried up the day after - and for the next 3 months I could not make the campaign perform. Tactics that worked well while hockey was on, had a 10x increase in CPA. \n\nIn my opinion, the volume of Hockey-skewed data messed up the bidder in the Baseball campaign since: \n\n* large volume hockey visitors converted and got attributed to baseball campaign via retargeting/broad sports targeting \n\n* algos/bidder kept intaking audience and placement signals that worked while Hockey was on and trying to find users similar to those that converted in April-May. \n\n\n\nSo, my questions are: \n\n* how do you think i can go about minimizing cross attribution given that the client wont build separate landing pages per sport and 90% of conversions are post-view\n\n* how do you feel about my theory of feeding wrong data signals to the bidder for 3 months, which made it basically impossible to recover and find a new audience (baseball audience) after? \n\n\nCurious to hear your answers!

The Trade Desk’s CMO Ian Colley called the tests “unfair,” arguing that Amazon performs well mainly because it directs spend toward its own properties rather than the open web.\n\nBut on the other side of the battlefield, AWS is getting defensive.  \nAs Google Cloud has been offering incentives and compute credits to lure ad tech companies over, AWS risked losing one of its most data-heavy verticals.\n\nNow it’s countering with RTB Fabric, a new real-time bidding infrastructure built inside AWS.\n\nIf two partners are on AWS within the same data center, they can communicate in microseconds instead of milliseconds, drastically cutting latency and networking costs (reportedly by up to 80%).\n\nThis aligns with AWS’s broader philosophy of “plug-and-play” openness, modularity, decentralization, and interoperability.\n\nRTB Fabric isn’t an open marketplace by itself but it fits right into that infrastructure mindset, giving ad tech firms more flexibility and control than Google’s more closed, vertically integrated ecosystem.\n\nThat last point matters.  \nGoogle is no longer seen as a “safe” infrastructure partner, not just because of competition, but due to mounting antitrust scrutiny. Many ad tech firms are understandably hesitant to run their operations on the same stack owned by a company being investigated for ad market dominance.\n\nAWS, by contrast, can credibly present itself as a more neutral infrastructure provider. even if everyone knows Amazon has its own motives.\n\nAnd there’s another layer:  \nas AI takes over ad tech, infrastructure needs will explode. The compute, data processing, and real-time modeling required for AI-driven ad optimization all funnel directly into AWS’s core business. That’s a built-in growth opportunity:  every AI advancement in ad tech drives more demand for AWS infrastructure.\n\nSo wdyt, is Amazon playing this right?",

So far, I’ve had the best response through **Amazon DSP** and **DV360**, running campaigns between **6–11pm**. I even got tagged in a few local Facebook groups where residents mentioned seeing my streaming TV ad which was great to see. Honestly, I think I might be one of the only small businesses in my area (or maybe even the state) doing any kind of programmatic advertising.\n\nI’ve also tested **DOOH**, including **in-theater ads** (about 20 theaters for two weeks — zero response), **screens in gyms, grocery stores, and retail** (also zero), and **digital billboards** via **Admatx (The Trade Desk)** targeting two local Lamar signs. The signs were impossible to miss — one-lane each way, 40mph road — but after a month (5pm–7pm rotation), I saw no measurable response.\n\n**YouTube Instant Guaranteed** got plenty of views but no noticeable leads. \n\nI also ran an **audio campaign** on Admatx across multiple platforms for two weeks, again zero response.\n\nAt this point, it really seems like **streaming TV** is the clear winner for local brand recognition. People notice it, comment on it, and we get actual leads from it. Sure, I could keep testing DOOH or audio for a few more months, but if one channel is delivering consistent awareness and results, it makes sense to double down there.\n\nThat said, I’m really curious, for those who work with **local businesses**, what ad types or strategies have you found to be most effective in generating real leads/sales?\n\nHappy to share more about all the tools and DSPs I’ve used if anyone’s interested.

I have recently found myself in a company that has 0 understanding of programmatic and only do direct deals for their gambling affiliated display content. As part of my new remit they want me to prove the value of programmatic by capitalising on around 270 million unfilled impressions worldwide. \n\nI have been able to set up an ad server / SSP (GAM), implemented some fairly standard ad sizes, mobile banner, top leaderboard, MPU's etc and have also implemented some KVP's for ATF/BTF and ad placement. However the fill rate currently is still very low around 5% with a £0.90 floor price. As I have never really worked in optimising delivery, I am asking if anyone has some helpful advice that could aid in filling the inventory space more consistently (was hoping for 50-60%)? I have a vague understanding of yield groups and could potentially look at utilising other SSP's to open up to more advertising traffic. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated for a newbie in this space!",

Also comparison makes only sense based on the same audiences, so let's say based on simple 1P retargeting data the advertiser brings to the table.

I'm not sure if running a fixed bid would be beneficial as we'd like a more dynamic bid tailored to performance. What's also frustrating though is we're not winning the best inventory. For pre-roll video our avg. CPM is less than $3 when previously we've typically seen pre-roll CPMs closer to $10-$15. So we're losing bids, and the ones we are winning are not great inventory.\n\n  \nHas anyone run in to a similar issue in DV360 and found something that works for you? Is fixed bid the only way to go? If so, how much do you usually bid? DV360 used to have a bid multiplier but it looks like it no longer has that feature.",

Also curious — what’s the average pay range like for someone with ~5 years of experience in programmatic?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone currently working remotely from India or who’s made a similar move.

Despite being a role somewhat unfamiliar to me, yet performing well, I love where I’m at present but it comes with a further 10% paycut. Effectively I’m on the same salary as I was back 2013 but now with family, mortgage, inflation it feels a lot worse. \n\nThe job market looks tough at the moment. I’m too long out of the game for hands-on-keyboard trading experience, and I’m not convinced agency sales is for me (I’m too old and don’t have the day to day media buyer network tech companies are seeking). \n\nI don’t have the senior commercial experience of running a P&L or man management experience for that matter as typically I’ve operated as a IC for the most part. That said I know I have good partnership experience and having some retail experience (both client and tech) feels like a good fit. But no idea where to start. ",
