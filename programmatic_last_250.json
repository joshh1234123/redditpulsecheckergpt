I do wish I could see what other platforms look like (I am only really well versed in two major DSPs) so I think people with agency experience will have a leg up, but at the end of the day it is a sales role, so you need to have the sales mentality... ie be good at sales, you can learn any product/platform in a few month.",

Dun & Bradstreet has really good B2B targeting for job hunters and targeting job titles (for poaching). Bombora also has good B2B datasets.\n\n\n2) Endemic site placement. Are you able to secure inventory on job / industry related sites. Indeed, monster, adweek, adexchanger, etc. \n\n3) What’s your messaging? Condensing an entire job posting into a banner ad is no small feat. If you were looking for a new job, what messaging or keywords would you want to see in an ad that would drive you investigate further?\n\n\n4) Your attribution engine. How are you going to qualify success? If you place a pixel on the sites application pages, job posting pages, and submission confirmation, you should be able to measure what media channels are driving success here for optimizations. Depending on your programmatic partner, You can also create LALs or retarget based on specific page visitation. \n\nThese are my KPI reccos (in order): \n- Conversions / application submissions - based on View-Thru if you’re running programmatic. Last touch always favors google.\n\n- Reach against the audience. You need a strong reach to get measurable results.\n\n- clicks. Clicks are dumb. At best, CTR should be a tertiary metric.\n\n- VTR if running video. But I’d only look at VTR to ensure the inventory you’re getting is quality. ie, CTV VTR should never be less than 93%. If under 90% I’d assume they’re mixing OLV into their CTV inventory.\n\n\nIn all, I’ve seen this tactic used in healthcare, home services, tech, IT, etc. Those 4 bullets above are how I’ve structured the approach and then pivoted for industry nuances.",

Spoiler: it is not. Anyone who is asking for such has no understanding of the ad type as these two ad products reach users in 2 completely different phases (programmatic during causal browsing while you’re focused on other content versus legit looking for a specific query) \n\nI think you mentioned you’re working in a silo, but I would recommend reviewing yourself or have them review their GA4/CRM. When running programmatic, you will almost always see an increase in leads/site visits/etc from direct, organic, referral, and even paid channels when prog ads are running. This is from brand recall - seeing the brand frequently enough that once the need arises, they’re more likely to conduct an online search (paid or organic) or type the website directly into the search bar. \n\nIf they’re insistent on leads, I would recommend having some form of conversion action set up in platform to be able to measure against as platform conversions will track view through, whereas GA4 is only click through. If you’re tracking a form fill, implement a conversion action for it; maybe even another action for form starts or a click to call numbers. \n\nGoodluck!",

      "content": "Focus: **Creative Load Time vs. Viewability**  \n  \nWe just wrapped up our July analysis, and one surprising trend stood out:  \n👉 ***Ads with slower creative load times often show higher viewability.***  \n  \nBut here’s the catch - it’s not the load time itself that drives performance.  \nIt’s really about:\n\n* Creative type (video, rich media tend to load slower but drive engagement) \n* Placement quality (premium slots often load after banners) \n* User behavior (scrolling patterns, dwell time, tab-switching, etc.) \n\nThe trade-off? Slower ads tend to hurt CTR and conversions even if they look more “viewable” in the metrics.  \n  \n**Market snapshot (July 2025):**  \nDisplay CPMs ↓ 0.5% MoM | ↓ 27% YoY  \nVideo CPMs ↓ 6% MoM | ↓ 21% YoY  \nMobile CPMs ↑ 4% MoM, but Desktop ↓ 13% MoM  \nCTV CPMs stood out with +55% YoY growth  \n  \n**Takeaway:**  \nViewability ≠ effectiveness. Optimizing for user experience, load times, and placement quality is more critical than chasing “slow = visible” scenarios.  \n  \nThe full dataset and breakdown (MoM/YoY, device-level, integrations, etc.), the full July Programmatic Trends report is here: [**Click Here**](https://databeat.io/blog/us-programmatic-trends-july-2025/?utm_source=reddit&&utm_medium=organic_social&&utm_campaign=us+programmatic+trends+july+2025)  \n  \nCurious for those running programmatic at scale:  \n👉 Have you seen slower/heavier creative formats showing “better” viewability in your environments? How are you balancing that with user experience?",

Looking for some advice on creating a VAST tag for a client’s video ad placement. Here’s the scoop:\n\nOur client’s placing a video billboard ad on a third-party advertiser’s site, and they’ve required us to create a VAST tag. While I’ve never done this, I brushed up on the steps to do so. Looks like I need access to Google Ad Manager, but since we don’t have AdSense as an agency, looks like this isn’t a possibility. We don’t sell ad real estate, only run campaigns and purchase it.\n\nLooks like the VAST tag itself is an XML file with html-coded parameters in it. Is this something I could easily code by hand and export for the vendor? Or is there an even simpler solution I’m not considering? Any help is appreciated, and hoping to learn from this for future endeavors. Thanks in advance!",

You'd use something like Google Campaign Manager 360, which is essentially just an ad  server, to do that.\n\nYou'd want to upload your creative file to CM360 and then build out your campaign and placements based on the hierarchy in the platform (https://support.google.com/campaignmanager/answer/2826636?hl=en&ref\\_topic=2826623&sjid=16440780722825694022-NA). From there, you'd download and send the tags generated by CM360 to the publisher -- Google does the work for you in that regard.\n\nThis is a fairly complicated tool to jump into with no experience, so you should probably tell the publisher you don't have any experience with this and ask if they can host the creative for you or something like that.",

I'm not saying it'll never happen, but usually if you're directly negotiating with a publisher, they're going to be more than willing to handle the creative hosting if you need it. I understand they have a cost that comes with ad serving (e.g., if you hosted the creative yourself in CM360, you'd pay a CPM fee somewhere around $0.25-$0.40 depending on your contract), but they should just be able to bake the cost of hosting your creative into your media buy.\n\nIf this is a quick-turn need, can you ask them if they could adjust the CPM to cover hosting the ad creative on your behalf? You'll get fewer impressions in total than what you agreed to up front, but that'll get the job done in a pinch. I can't imagine any publisher wouldn't be willing to work with you.",

I confirmed all of this on a screenshare and everything looked correct from my somewhat untrained eye (I do have buy side experience in MediaMath and DBM that's from years ago obviously).  \n\nI did find on the Amazon DSP training that said some SSPs including Freewheel (our SSP) needs a child seat.  I'm not entirely sure what that means or how that would help, but I welcome any ideas!

One of their per-employeement questionnaires was passed around (again) on Reddit and it is indeed totally devoid of relevant job questions and is indeed filled with really strange and vague questions that have no relevance to the job.\n\nThis is why I don't have a job at a big tech company. I have no idea what those weird questions are or how to answer them as they have absolutely nothing to do with the job I would be doing there. So, there's no point in even bothering throwing them a resume, because there's absolutely no way I can navigate that Machiavellian maze of total BS. So, there's no point...\n\nThey're clearly just creating a system where you're going to \"get one of the questions wrong\" so, they always have a technically valid reason to not employee you. It's totally one sided. It's actually impossible to answer the questions \"correctly,\" because the questions are worded in a way where they're so ambiguous, that there's no universally correct answer, because that's not how English works. It's like they're asking you subjective questions deterministically, giving you no valid range for an exclusively correct answer.\n\nSo, they don't care about my ability as a software architect, but it matters that I'm a Unix hater. Oh kay now... They couldn't put a bigger \"don't waste your time sign\" there if they tried. So, I have to hate an old OS that basically led to creation of the internet, because they don't like the licensing agreement? I can't actually work with people that are that totally dishonest.\n\nIf that's the culture of goons they cultivated over there, then it's for a sure a complete waste of my time. Obviously their products are filled with bugs and crapware. Obviously... It makes complete sense... They don't want the care bears that actually give a care and value what they're doing, they want the haters...",

Go deep in that practice. Agency side is a great starting point for that. People tend to overlook hands-on experience, but it will help you in the long run as it shows when someone never piloted a campaign, nor ever step foot in a DSP environment. \n\n Then I suggest pivoting to a more client-facing programmatic media strategy / media planning role if that's interesting to you. The combination of both hands-on experience + strategy will serve you well to ramp up and build your career, whether its DSP/adtech, client or agency side. I made the switch from agency to freelance and that mix is working great for me, 5 years in now. \n\nHope that helps!",

I think some white-label Prebid or white-label SSP providers offer a convenient GUI for integrating third-party DSPs, or charge 0% commission for connecting new DSPs. Or maybe you already have full-time developers that need to be kept busy since they are paid anyway. In my understanding, 20–30 req/sec would not create a noticeable server load. Also, integration usually does not take much time if the protocol is compatible and there is Prebid compatibility. (In my sandbox I already run my own Prebid server, with a DSP connected on one side and a test site on the other)\n\nRegarding the $10–20K per month ad spend - I know ad networks for whom $1-3K per month is enough to get connected. But at the current stage I don’t need such a big spend. First, I want to stabilize the system and collect the first successful cases myself before charging anyone for it. So right now this is more like an internal tool for affiliate marketing, and I’m not in a rush. I don’t need to maintain a team of people, just my own time and around $100 for production servers. In the meantime, I will also be slowly customizing my own Prebid server, creating and connecting mobile apps. Maintaining apps is cheaper than maintaining websites, since they don’t require hosting.",

      "content": "Hi r/programmatic! \n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about what it takes to build a truly exceptional career in our industry and wanted to pose a question to this community. There are so many experienced people here from the buy-side, sell-side, ad tech, and everywhere in between, and I’m hoping to learn from your diverse perspectives.\n\nI've been working in the space for over 7 years, primarily on the sell-side. I feel like I have a strong handle on my role, but I'm driven to keep improving. Lately, I've been wondering what separates the people who are simply \"good\" at their jobs from the individuals who are in the absolute top 1% of the field.\n\nBeyond just \"working hard,\" what does that next level look like? I'm curious what this community thinks. For example:\n\n* **Technical Skills:** Is it purely deep mastery of platforms (a specific DSP/SSP, GAM, etc.), or is the differentiator broader technical expertise like SQL, Python, or data visualization for unique analysis?\n* **Soft Skills:** How much of it comes down to things like masterful negotiation, next-level client communication, or the ability to tell a compelling story with data to senior stakeholders?\n* **Strategic Thinking:** Is it an almost intuitive grasp of auction dynamics? A macro-level view of where the industry is headed and the ability to position for it? Or is it a deep understanding of a client's business that goes far beyond campaign metrics?\n* **Mindset:** Are there specific habits, frameworks for thinking, or learning processes that you've consistently seen in the top performers you've worked with?\n\nI'm not looking for a secret formula, just genuinely curious to hear different takes on this. Eager to read your thoughts and learn from the discussion!",

      "content": "Hi everyone\n\nI've been in the media buying side of things for a few years now, mostly focused on lower funnel performance with very tight and stressful targets (and with low budgets as well, max 20k a month), yet somehow I find it fun (I might be crazy), but not long ago I joined a somewhat \"large\" agency to its programmatic team and to be honest I see some things very off to me, but they seem to be \"normal\" when talking with colleagues and reading this subreddit. So I wanted to ask everyone here directly.\n\n1) How is it possible that large advertisers throw up hundreds of thousands of dolars to programmtic for the sake of reach and CTR? It seems like as long as you match the media plan targets you are a fucker and did your job. Excuse me? How do these companies don't even try to \"tie\" somehow this wasted ad spend to some measurable results? \n\nComing from a performance background I actually applied some of my old book techniques and results in the current campaigns I manage increased dramatically and everyone around seemed surprised in the agency.\n\n2) Is it normal for programmatic to just worry about CTR or am I missing something? Because what I see is that all budget coming to programmatic is just wasted with no real outcome, but somehow this is normal and everyone keeps pouring money into it??\n\n3) When it comes to campaign performance, the best optimizations by far are tweaks/changes on the actual landing pages (at least according to my exp) but here nothing of this is done and its like \"wtf, just change this or that and results will dramatically improve\". How is it that normal to just work on the campaigns in platform? That's just \"distributing\" the message, not driving real actions, those are managed if the UX in the landing page is well done.\n\n4) Why is it that programmatic is constantly focused on awareness? I get it's a top channel for that but why nobody tries to do performance (real performance) as well? Even if it cannot compete as well with social or search ads?\n\nWhen in calls with clients/colleagues it's widely accepted that in programmatic we just need to focus on spending the money and have the expected reach, cpm and CTR. And that's all to it. Like, WTF? I do believe in programmatic we can do way more than just being \"those guys that do nothing\" and to be honest it feels incredibly frustrating. \n\nThing is that when talking with way more experienced colleagues than me in programmatic I see they lack many notions to very basic performance/business logics but it doesn't bother them and bosses are happy, clients somehow are happy and everything seems to hold in this apparent fragile equilibrium.\n\nIs any of this normal? What am I missing? Is that really all to it? Again, it's a large company that manages millions in advertising budgets, but they always attribute all client revenue exclusively to social ads or search, while in programmatic we are just \"there\" spending and \"raising awareness\".\n\nOverall I feel very confused right now and not sure if I want to keep working in programmatic because of this. What am I missing? Can you people share your thoughts on this? Am I the only one? I'd really like to understand.\n\nThanks if you read everything, I needed to get this out of my chest.",

          "body": "I used to also think that you’d should tie a campaign to a performance goal like sales, cpa, etc but the truth of the matter is that the vast majority of people don’t actually interact with ads and programmatic is really good at targeting a bunch of people that may or may not have been exposed to your brand before.  Theres also a boatload of advertisers where their website sales mean nothing compared to in-store sales at retailers.\n\nIt is kinda crazy that CTR is the key benchmark but that’s how agencies sell it. Non marketing executives also understand a click metric. But in reality, it’s hard to quantify programmatic display from a performance standpoint compared to search and social. Viewthrough conversions aren’t tracked in analytics platforms like GA4 or Shopify so relying on just DSP conversion data as the source of truth really doesn’t mean much because it takes credit for all conversions that a display ad touch without any consideration for other channel touch points. Back in the day like 5ish years ago it was a lot easier to track path to conversion across channels so you could see how programmatic played a role in the conversion path but with cookieless/walled gardens/iphone privacy in the past few years this has made it more difficult to do. \n\nUltimately people need to know about your brand before considering so focusing on just performance with programmatic will limit your overall reach. It’s more important to reach the target audience at a decent frequency so that they actually have brand recall.",

For the smaller businesses, every marketing dollar is scrutinized and investigated to help the business grow. When working in programmatic for large multinational corporations, programmatic and digital marketing budgets are just a small responsibility of a marketing director's job. In the end, they want to retain their budgets every year which is why they emphasize spending in full so procurement/finance let's them keep the same budgets. As to why not everything is tied to outcomes, it's partially because they have dedicated performance budgets or because a large part of their view on marketing is that it's about awareness and brand building.\n\nNeither of the two approaches is necessarily wrong, but the way you execute and understanding how people perceive your brand should be key. All you need to do to see a real life example of this is Nike's failed shift from brand focused advertising to a full performance brand, which they're now heavily back pedalling on. They've probably figured out that in the end performance marketing isn't the main driver of their growth and focusing too much of their marketing spend in that direction has averse affects on their brand image.",

That confirms which channels delivered and at what scale. 3) Path to Conversion: include Touchpoint Position and Inventory Type to see sequences; add Conversion Details to see final-touch channel. 4) Optional sanity checks: Reach & Frequency by Inventory Type to verify dedupe; label lines by channel for cleaner slicing. Also align attribution windows and confirm your universal pixel + events are on advertiser level.\n\nFor cross-checking, I’ve used GA4 and Adobe Analytics for intake, but HeatMap helped tie on-site click patterns to revenue when validating TTD’s channel mix.\n\nNet: use Inventory Type + deduped reach and PTC to prove multichannel in TTD.",

Is it creative costs, targeting, measurement, or just getting started?\n\n\t•\tMid-Market advertisers – For those spending around $250k range annually on ads, what challenges do you face with CTV? (e.g., proving ROAS, signal loss, fragmented reporting, limited tools built for mid-sized budgets, etc.)\n\n\t•\tEnterprise brands – For larger advertisers with big budgets, what are the blockers to scaling CTV as a performance channel? (e.g., attribution gaps, cross-screen measurement, walled garden dependency, cost efficiency, etc.)\n\n💰 As a quick benchmark: if you’re comfortable sharing, how much are you typically spending on CTV per year?\n\nThe goal here isn’t to pitch anything, but to collect insights from real practitioners so I can understand where Performance CTV delivers today and where it falls short.\n\nWould really appreciate your thoughts — even a couple of sentences on your biggest frustration would help a lot!\n\nThanks in advance 🙏\n",

Meaning, if I have $100, and the % is 10%, then $90 is for media, $10 is what the agency pockets.  $90 is all-inclusive media budget (what you’d enter in the DSP).  Platform and data fees were included, so it’s passed on.\n\nThe above example is for a transparent client.  Agencies operate with transparent and opaque cost models, so it’s hard to say how an opaque cost model will handle the fees.  Our opaque models did not pass along fees, meaning if I inputted $90 in a DSP, inventory costs would equal $90, total media costs would equal $90 + platform fee + data.  The gotcha is that in an opaque models did, the margin is way, way higher.",

Do they have a voice at the table in terms of allocation? Do they get to share their take on platforms? \n\nPlease note: this is not to devalue or denigrate their hard work.

But my leadership hardly knows their names and doesn’t blink when they leave the agency for another job as they know we’ll find the next entry level replacement. \n\nI find it insanely odd that TTD puts their traders forward in marketing materials like this. It seems totally disconnected from the reality of what I’ve seen at multiple agencies and across multiple teams at those agencies. \n\nIn any case, from one manager to all the HOKs out there, your work matters, we can’t do this without you, but it looks like if you want an existence akin to a Hindu cow TTD is your best bet because I don’t see that anywhere else.

I’d say campaigns I ran really well are the ones where the messaging is contextually relevant to the ad, for example a travel brand leveraging weather triggers. If you’re also buying other channels in an omni-channel DSP, OOH is a great way to drive depth and capture more market share based on which zip codes are driving performance on digital channels. Retargeting is also a great tactic, due to as someone mentioned before, receptivity for OOH is higher than TV or Digital and we use OOH to warm up consumers for higher engagement on lower funnel tactics. We’ve seen much shorter conversion windows based on reporting from TTD when OOH is in the path to conversion.\n\nIn terms of measurement, there’s been significant growth in the industry in the last 5 years or so. You can set up pixels on your landing/conversion pages and match deviceIDs of those exposed to OOH for attribution. I’d also recommend including OOH into your MMMs, and geo-lift incrementality tests. \n\nOverall, it isn’t fair to say OOH isn’t measurable and it’s just an awareness play. Tons of research and data out there shows that it’s an effective performance channel in a space that isn’t as saturated as what we’re seeing on CTV, digital and social.",

Where it does shine, however, is when you supplement it with your online campaigns. You’re exposing people online, for example, and then they also get your brand when they’re out walking around and seeing the big screen — the repeat exposure helps a lot for recall.\n\nIn terms of formats, I’ve seen transit screens, large-format billboards, and store DOOH do very well for awareness.

But if part of a multi-channel programmatic strategy, it makes a lot of sense as it’s less-intrusive, it’s “breaking a mold” or it’s “different” than other programmatic formats (not only in terms of look and feel, but certainly in terms of planning, etc) and it allows for logical QR code scanning and different types of interaction.\n\nI recommend getting in touch with a Vistar or Place Exchange rep and having them talk through their methodology, planning/forecasting tools, venue/screen types, etc and go from there.",

If your agency is using Stackadapt over DV360/Amazon/TTD, then you should be worried, because you're paying whatever your agency's markup is + stack's markup, which can be even higher than your agency's... and the agency might just be passing off the work to stack anyways, and just taking the cut.",

So now I need to create a third-party tag and place that link into that tag so that everything would work great (the banner is visible, it clicks through, and clicks and viewability would be counted). \n\nI tried to solve it with ChatGPT, which provided me with a tag, and when trying it out in DV360, it seemed to work nicely. However, when looking at the stats afterwards, I see that viewability is just a bit over 0% and I get traffic from weird non-standard domains. About that problem, ChatGPT said:\n\n*\"🔹 Why your iframe script failed*\n\n* *Your tag is just “dumb JS” that injects an iframe.*\n* *It does* ***not declare any DV360 macros*** *(other than ${CLICK\\_URL} in the iframe URL).*\n* *Because of that, DV360:*\n   * *Can’t correctly map impressions/clicks to placement.*\n   * *Can’t track viewability (there’s no DV360 signal layer inside the iframe).*\n   * *Ends up serving on low-quality / “remnant” inventory → hence the weird domains & near-zero viewability.*\n\n*Basically: DV360 treated it as an unverified 3rd-party iframe, not a proper creative with tracking hooks.\"*\n\n  \nHowever, ChatGPT doesn't really give me a working script. Maybe someone has had a similar problem and knows how to solve it?\n\n\\---\n\nThe script I used was:\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> (function() { var creative = document.createElement('iframe'); creative.src = \"https://www.testbanner.com/?click=${CLICK\\_URL}\"; creative.width = \"300\"; // set your banner width creative.height = \"250\"; // set your banner height creative.frameBorder = \"0\"; creative.scrolling = \"no\"; creative.marginHeight = \"0\"; creative.marginWidth = \"0\"; document.body.appendChild(creative); })(); </script>",

For example:\n\n* How does a programmatic auction work?\n* How does an ad server function?\n* How does bidding actually work?\n* What exactly do a DSP and an SSP do?\n* What is header bidding?\n* What happens step by step in a programmatic auction?\n* How does cookie syncing work?\n\nThese are just a few key examples.

We’ve been running DV360 programmatic display ads through an agency for a while now, but the results have been pretty disappointing with almost no conversions. I’m starting to think it might make sense to test Google Ads display campaigns instead, since I feel like the GDN could actually perform better in terms of driving conversions.\n\nFor those of you who’ve worked with both, how different is the inventory and performance between DV360 and Google Ads display? Is DV360 really that much more effective, or does GDN cover most of what matters anyway?\n\nThis is for an online casino brand, so I know performance can be tricky, but I’d love to hear your general take.",

If your attribution is quite standard, it is very unlikely you will ever see it outperform those 2 channels, regardless of whether it is DV360 or Google Ads\n* If you are running Search via Google, are you using PMAX / Demand Gen? Granted both are blackboxes with plenty of grey areas but the overlap from a display inventory specifically is likely overlapping with your programmatic activity\n* As others have said, Google is much more stricter with gambling. Historically this is where a MediaMath / Xandr would mop up a lot of the gambling advertiser marketplace for programmatic. But to run a DSP correctly in a sensitive vertical is not that straight forward\n* What exactly is your measurement / attribution model? If it is last click then you are already on the back foot to prove any value of programmatic.

          "body": "StackAdapt doesn't have any of its own inventory. It's just a DSP that taps into other inventory providers. DV360 will probably give you the most reach simply because it allows you to buy YouTube inventory, which is the biggest video service on the planet.\n\nAs a small business, you don't have a reach problem from my perspective. You'll likely never be able to spend enough money to penetrate the full market with your budgets, so you need to find ways to make more impact with less money. To your point, playing most of your ads on Tubi or Pluto might not be the best strategy, albeit people *do* watch these services, so I think you need to refine your buying strategy rather than rethink your DSP. DV360 and Amazon DSP might be too full-featured for what you're looking for since they're primarily designed for enterprise-level customers with bigger budgets. It's good that people have mentioned your ads when you were using DV360/Amazon in the past, so maybe you just found out YouTube is not the best way to engage people.\n\nIt's hard to make a full recommendation without more budget details and background info on your business, but you could honestly consider something simple like Universal Ads (Comcast/NBCU's self-serve ad platform that taps directly into their inventory) or Disney Campaign Manager (direct access to Disney+, Hulu, ESPN). Those platforms are more lacking in terms of targeting and whatnot, but they're also designed for SMBs and offer comparatively low CPMs. Universal Ads doesn't really have much targeting beyond genre targeting now, but you could get into some solid CTV inventory for like $8-10 CPMs, which could be effective if you're just trying to promote a brick-and-mortar location in a very defined geographic area. Disney Campaign Manager has more targeting options, but the CPMs are higher because the inventory is usually more competitive.\n\nEither way, I don't think you should be looking to add yet another DSP to your mix, and I don't think you need to turn to something like Tatari or MNTN because those are sus in my opinion anyway. If you're truly a smaller business, you could do well with Universal Ads or Disney Campaign Manager, or you could simply refine your buying strategies on Amazon and DV360.",

If you're a Google Partner or book through an agency (and if you have a DV360 seat, I’d assume that’s the case), YouTube is basically the same between Google Ads and DV360. Sometimes certain beta and alpha tests are limited to either DV or Google Ads (many of them only to Google Ads).\n\nOn both platforms you have access to:\n\n- Programmatic guaranteed through Instant Reserve and YouTube Select. All fully self-bookable.\n- Demand Gen as the mid-funnel option\n- All automated and combined format strategies like Video Reach, Video View and other mixed-format campaigns\n- Different types of bidding, usually fully dependent on the format (CPM, CPV, CPA/ROAS with Demand Gen)\n- 20s, 30s and 60s Non-Skippables\n- Brand Lift studies\n- Cross-Media Reach Reports incl. TV\n- Third-party measurement through certified partners (like Nielsen & IAS)\n\nDV only:\n- Frequency cap across all inventory within your dv  campaign (a huge plus if you’re also running PA/PD deals across a lot of other video inventory)\n- cross media reach reports including other video inventory\n- if needed: it's a tad easier to automate unique reach reporting, as this is not available in the Google Ads Api and only within the UI\n- Con: additional DV fee\n\nFor many features, you need your Google Account Rep to whitelist your account. That applies to both Google Ads and DV360.\n\nIMHO, in DV, since YouTube is set up very differently from all other DV IO/LI, it’s basically just a Google Ads container in the backend hosting the campaign. Insertion Order settings don’t affect YouTube, and you must configure basically everything within the line item.\n\nDepending on your workflow, tech stack and client, both platforms are valid choices. You really don’t miss much in either one.\n\nSmall side note: it's Google Ads now. AdWords hasn't existed since 2018.",

He's promising October announcements about innovations designed to improve the digital ad ecosystem for buy-side clients.\n\n**The context:** Trade Desk reports Q3 earnings in early November. Two narratives have been dogging the company: the open web is in decline, and TTD is losing ground. Green's positioning AI as the answer to both problems.\n\n**The actual announcements:** TTD is rolling out two new AI-powered features. First is a[ tool ](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250929471947/en/The-Trade-Desk-Announces-Major-Overhaul-of-Digital-Advertising-Data-Marketplace?utm_source=beehiiv&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=u-of-digital-newsletter-10-1-25-premium&_bhlid=b7dca467d992e70868dd73a495e673d0e5d370fa)that uses machine learning to evaluate and rank audience segments across hundreds of data vendors, replacing their current pay-per-provider model with simplified pricing that could cut data costs (which currently eat up nearly a fifth of media budgets). Second is new trading modes (Koa Adaptive Trading Modes) that let buyers choose between fully automated AI optimization(called Performance Mode) or hands-on(called Control Mode) campaign management with manual bidding and allocation controls. Both launch with select agencies later this year, then wider rollout early 2026.\n\n**The pitch:** These AI innovations will \"accelerate the inevitable long-term movement toward a transparent and efficient marketplace for digital ads.\"\n\nEither this is a legitimate shift in how programmatic buying works, or it's a well-timed product launch to reshape the conversation before earnings.\n\nWe'll know more in November.",

      "content": "Integral Ad Science (IAS) is being acquired by private equity firm Novacap for $1.9 billion, taking the company private just four years after its 2021 IPO.\n\n**The deal:**\n\n* Canadian PE firm Novacap buying IAS at $10.30/share (22% premium)\n* Vista Equity Partners (majority owner since 2018) exiting completely\n* Expected to close later this year, pending regulatory approval\n\n  \n**Why this matters:**\n\nIAS and DoubleVerify basically run ad verification as a duopoly. They've already captured most of the market, but there's a massive problem: nowhere left to grow.\n\nMarketers see verification as a necessary evil and a necessary tax, not something they want to spend more on. IAS's attempts to expand into ad serving and attribution haven't moved the needle. Big platforms are building their own brand safety tools in-house, eating into market share.\n\n**The real threat: Scope3**\n\nWhile IAS dealt with Adalytics reports and government scrutiny this year, AI-first startup Scope3 has been rebuilding verification from the ground up. Founder Brian O'Kelley (former AppNexus CEO) literally posted on LinkedIn about why IAS is going private: to compete with him.\n\nHis take: Going private gives you breathing room to rebuild without quarterly earnings calls, but it's not enough. You still need to invest heavily in R&D, embrace AI/agents, and move fast. If customers start asking, \"Do I need this if I have AI?\" and your answer isn't compelling, private equity won't save you.\n\n**The bigger picture:**\n\nThis is the beginning of a pattern. Legacy adtech built on rules-based systems is entering adapt-or-die mode. AI-native competitors that are lightweight and dynamic are the future.\n\nAd verification is just the start. Which other \"mature\" adtech sectors (DSPs, SSPs, DMPs) will see this same story play out in the next 2-3 years?\n\n**My take:**   \nGoing private buys IAS time to gut the product, rebuild around AI, and make risky bets without Wall Street breathing down its neck. Expect major changes in the next 18-24 months. The question is whether it'll be enough.\n\nWhat do you think? Can legacy adtech companies successfully reinvent themselves? ",

Only about 10,000 on the list.  The list is my perfect local avatar. Vibe thinks they can match about 50% to 60% of my list. \n\nI would be the “star” of the ad. 😂\n\nBut I would also do direct mail to the same list that vibe was able to match. Basically the same messaging from the video ad. \n\nNow - the biggest issue, which I don’t think is an issue personally, is that I may not be able to utilize all of the $50 daily spend because of list size. I’m okay with that because of how targeted it is. \n\nAnd I plan on doing direct mail to the rest of the list that wasn’t matched in Vibe as a test to see if Vibe is having an impact on response rates from the direct mail. I am fairly positive the vibe ads will increase response rates from the direct mail. \n\nUpdate Edit: They can't tell me who they matched and who they did not. So, I would need to mail everyone on the list and hope that the ads increase the response rates on the direct mail as I am not expecting much response from the ads themselves. \n\n",

They could solve the TID issue for premium publishers tomorrow with one simple little UI tweak that has been possible for years (like at least the last 6+) yet they have hidden in the API never to let it see the light of day: Volume Control. Volume control essentially makes the DSP prioritize specific attributes for bid submission over others. They made a half ass version of it for Commitments, but the raw API version is a game changer in buying logic. It allows to you tier your supply properties even within a PMP to ensure you focus dollars/bids exactly where you want them. Want to make sure as much of your budget goes to vendors wit a TID? Volume control setting at 2 and drop all others to -1. You’ll only bid on the non TID supply when you absolutely have to to maintain pacing. \n\nWhy is TTD not making this simple UI tweak? Because TID isn’t about buyer transparency it’s about maintaining data infrastructure cost for TTD in their aging tech stack. If a pub sends 20x bid requests for the same impression that’s 20x the cost TTD needs to crunch in the exchange and store in post exchange processing that they don’t want eating into their margins. \n\nInstead of giving clients a simple and easy solution to force sellers to align to the buyers wants, they are convoluting the entire programmatic market with this mini-garden effort to shave 1% off their effective margin which they think keeps Wall Street happy, but somehow are ignoring that fact Wall St is plainly over TTD with the cuts analyst have given the company across the board. Wall Street analysts don’t care about this crap or Ventura OS, they want pure growth plain and simple. TTD is showing Wall St yet again its leadership is easily distracted by stupid esoteric fights instead of dealing with the increasing encroachment of Amazon. What a joke",

Ex: [Travel](https://premion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PREMION-Why-CTV-OTT-for-Travel-Tourism.pdf). \n\nMy biggest issue with them is they are not trying to listen and setup a campaign for success, they are setting it up for their Ad Ops efficiency. This is especially true if you are running other channels thru your own house or thru other partners. An example of this would be you ask to run sports, they hear that and say SURE! Then your running on re-runs of games on Pluto (when you wanted NFL). Yes it's what you asked for, but they don't clarify or ask questions.  \n\nYou can make it work with them if the price is right, but be sure to ask for things like:\n\n* Hours (only 6am - 10pm) or whatever works for you.  \n* Full list of APPs they can run on (it will be limited) IE you want Paramount+ they may not be able to get you that. BUT they will have the Paramount logo on their presentations b/c their getting that inventory thru Pluto OR Fubo. \n   * Issue with them is their a corporation, most of the time they are not trying to go outside their own bubble of inventory. \n   * They probably are not going to setup custom campaigns for you either if they can't support it or they don't have the scale for it. \n* What networks / content / devices / apps you don't want to go on.\n* SETUP a KPI, If you can get them to place a pixel on whatever your tracking. \n* What audiences can they work with? 1st Party, 3rd party etc. Can they do Retargeting? \n   * Can they match the audiences you are using on other channels? \n   * Ask to the see the segments they are using IE they could be using [Mosaic Audiences ](https://assets.cengage.com/gale/help/dnow/DataMethodology/MosaicUSA_Handbook.pdf)when you wanted to target HH with $150k + & 2 kids.\n\nIn my experience they have some cool tools like the Arrivalist that you might not be able to get thru anyone else at a $10k budget. BUT you have to force them to give you what you want alot of the time. They are not going to be setting you up for success unless you walk them thru the process. \n\nFeel free to pull the plug if they bait and switch you. It's your biggest superpower.   \nHope that helps.",

I haven’t worked with Premion directly, but from what I’ve seen, they’re really focused on DMAs and local campaigns. My sense is their CTV/OTT inventory isn’t hugely different from other SSPs- it looks to be less. The real question is whether you want to manage another UI just for CTV, or if you’d rather stick with an omnichannel solution that covers everything. Quite frankly you can get similar results with other non CTV focused companies. \n\nIf I were digging into them, I’d ask stuff like:\n\n\\- Are there any exclusive partnerships or inventory that actually set you apart?\n\n\\- Other vendors often struggle to scale DMA or zipcode targeting. How do you solve that where others can’t?\n\n\\- How transparent is your reporting? Can you see exactly which show and spot the ad ran on?\n\nDM me if you want to provide more info.",

We’ve had around 7 impression conversions in StackAdapt, and can match 5 of them to real form fills — but 1–2 are missing, which is making the client question the tracking. Another thing that is happening is they are showing a UTM reference to StackAdapt on a particular date but we're not seeing it in StackAdapt.\n\nIt feels like there will always be some slight discrepancy in attribution models, but I’d love to hear how others explain this or validate the data with clients.

Sat through the demos, got the rep assigned, whole nine yards.\n\nFirst thing I noticed - it's literally TTD. Like the interface is TTD, the documentation is ttd, even the fucking URL structure is TTD. which cool, at least I'm not learning a completely new platform.\n\nThe audience targeting based on actual purchase behavior is legit. We can see what someone bought at Walmart and target them accordingly. The closed-loop attribution shows real incremental lift, not the usual \"last click gets all the credit\" bullshit.\n\nTrying to compare performance against our other TTD campaigns though? nightmare. The reporting doesn't quite line up. Walmart Connect has its own dashboard that shows retail-specific metrics but then you've got your TTD dashboard showing different numbers. reconciling what happened in-store vs online vs offsite is just spreadsheet hell.\n\nAlso the account management is completely separate from TTD. Different reps, different SLAs, different response times. same tech stack but you're managing two completely different relationships.\n\noh and if your client does business with Walmart already? Good fucking luck separating out the retail media performance from everything else they've got going on with them. their sales team doesn't talk to the Connect team apparently.\n\nWas it worth it? Yeah honestly, the attribution alone justifies it if you've got clients selling through Walmart. but anyone telling you it's seamless because it's TTD under the hood is full of shit.\n\nAnyone else running Walmart Connect alongside regular TTD? how are you handling the reporting situation?",

Re the other items, all hear say so to your point could just be a pub or two sharing their own perspective that I’ve run into over the years. \n\nIt’s just often we see people default to assumptions here vs thinking more deeply about the fact everyone has a business to run, so whether open path or non, someone has to make money, and they aim to deliver enough value in excess of that money so that the end buyer has a net positive experience and invests more.

Multipliers were designed to give directional guidance — not to be treated as hard metrics. Over time, those modeled numbers started being reported as “actual impressions,” which distorts the baseline of performance.\n\nI agree that independent studies and integrations with payment or mobility data (like MasterCard, ABCS, etc.) are steps forward — they validate impact.\nWhat’s still missing is validation of exposure.\n\nWe’ve reached a stage where technologies like computer vision, anonymized face detection, and AI-based dwell tracking can provide real, privacy-compliant viewability data.\n\nIf OOH wants to compete with digital, it can’t keep measuring potential; it needs to measure actual.\n\nAppreciate your insight though — you’re right, this isn’t simple.

I have around 5 years of exp between programmatic and ppc. It's a work I enjoy and have fun with (but not to be underpaid, or at least its how I feel like) and why not saying it, I'm good at.\n\nMy questions for you, how do you see currently the job market on the programmatic end in europe? What salaries in northern/nordics countries are average for somebody of my experience on average? Any advice or tips when doing this job switch? I'd like to still work in programmatic, but again, I have experience on full funnel media buying.\n\nI dont mind at all taking more responsibilities, I just want to get properly paid for it.\n\nJust another guy trying to make his way in the galaxy as Jango Fett would say.\n\nThanks everyone, if you have questions for me or need more context, I'll happy provide.

What stood out is that mid-traffic publishers (ranks 501–2000) contributed the most to that growth, adding around 14.8k new lines.\n\nOn the SSP side:\n\n* **Unruly** and Connatix saw the strongest uptick in new direct entries.\n* **Blis, TrustedStack, MobileFuse,** and **SCREENCORE** all climbed in rank among scaling and emerging players.\n* Larger “established” SSPs seem to be hitting some duplication issues - showing up both as direct and reseller connections on the same domains, which could be causing unnecessary auction overlap.\n\nSeems like the market is slowly shifting away from purely high-traffic publisher focus and into more mid/long-tail partnerships. Curious if others here are seeing similar patterns in your own data or platform side?\n\nFull dataset and breakdown are up here if anyone wants to look at the numbers: [Click here](https://databeat.io/blog/sellers-report-october-2025/?utm_source=reddit&&utm_medium=organic_social&&utm_campaign=sellers+report+october+2025)",

DoubleVerify operates both (since they bought OpenSlate). Then there are more YT specific vendors in Zefr / Pixability etc. Some offer Channel level and some do Video / Keyword level.\n\nPost-bid is 2 parts: an UI scheduled report (which all the Pre-bid guys do) which has flaws.

At their core, I believe most of these companies provide lists of YouTube channels that are \"good\" (allow list) and/or \"bad\" (block list), customized for each brand's needs. DV owns OpenSlate, a YouTube channel management company (custom allow lists) and there may be cost efficiencies if you use them elsewhere. Filament and Pixability mentioned by Lumiafan are worth checking out as well. Decide whether you want a full service buying solution or a tech tool to manage your channels when talking to these companies.\n\nThe options in Google are not great but have gotten a bit better; I would recommend excluding \"content suitable for families\" for any brand not targeting children. You can always run for a few days and see how terrible the placement reporting is (you'll probably be horrified).

The answer is any programmatic not tied to a platform dependent on search referrals. So not publishers, not most middleware\n\nThere will be a medium-term future where Google removes most of the traffic referrals publishers get, in order to shore up its no-click AI offering, which it believes is the direction of travel. That may be five years, it may be two years, who knows -the the AI prize is too big for Google to ignore. So what does the ecosystem look like under those conditions, and who best to work for?\n\nPublishers will still exist, with much less traffic, and therefore much fewer staff. Subscriptions will be more prevalent than they are now, and most traffic (for large publishers) will be allocated to direct sales because of the higher yield. In other words, programmatic will take the hit. More publishers will outsource programmatic to the large aggregators in order to tie cost to revenue, but those networks will still see overall traffic declines and shrink themselves.\n\nWith less publisher traffic, SSPs and DSPs and all the middleware take the hit and also contract. Margins and volume decrease. This also affects retail media because there are fewer retargeting opportunities, CTV may be ok but the demand isn't there for many channels. Apps should be ok, if they can find new users.\n\nSocial, apps, CTV.",

They generally won't be able to afford different teams for on-site, off-site, programmatic, social, search, etc- it'll all be one team, with everyone being big generalists. You'll be able to learn a lot of different platforms which will make you an easier hire for a bigger agency.\n\nDSP side generally is good salary/bonuses and healthcare packages, but not a ton of upward mobility, and depending how sales-focused your team is it can be pretty high-pressure(like if you're an AM), but if you're more on the execution side, things seem more chill.\n\n  \nBig agencies probably wind up paying you the worst, but they're good for exposure, especially if you want to get a DSP job- you'll make connections at all the big partners.\n\nI've never worked client side, but I've heard it's the lowest stress/highest security of all the options.",

I have tried setting up displays on TTD, but same issue and I really believe I still have a lot of areas for me to explore. \n\nYes, I can take some online courses and do some self-learning, but I think the best way for me to really learn is to be on board of actual executions.\n\nI am not actually looking for a high-paying job, I just like to be in a space where learning is valued as much as performance with a team or mentor open to sharing insights and best practices. Thanks!",

We are exclusively on select premium publishers / partners via PMP/PD/PG deals, and on YouTube (Canada). We've tried YouTube target frequency, but we don't like the restriction in YT channel targeting with that buy type. \n\nWe are using DV360 as a DSP for the most part. Has anyone been through that thinking and have any inputs? \n\nWe use Amazon Ads for some activations around Prime Video and Twitch, and that DSP has a great target frequency function, that unfortunately DV360 doesn't have.

I always found that odd because an impression from CTV is worth a lot more than an impression from display, but I'm also not really in that sort of advertising space.\n\nNot sure if I'm really answering your question on this, but I think a \"Campaign Group\" is either to manage reach and frequency or simply make it easier to roll up reporting across multiple channels through naming conventions.

Basically something with timestamps, floor prices, site/app IDs, auction type, winning price, maybe a few bid responses. Doesn’t have to be real-time, just realistic enough to simulate auctions and test strategies.\n\nIf anyone knows public sources, synthetic generators, or has their own sample logs (sanitized, no PII) they can share or sell  please drop a link or DM me.\nAlso curious how others usually simulate this — do you use open datasets, generate synthetic logs, or record real traffic and strip IDs?\n\nThanks in advance 🙌",

I’ve been in programmatic for roughly that same amount of time, and I really enjoy the work overall.\n\nSince starting here in September, though, I’ve noticed the pace is *insanely* fast. It often feels like we’re constantly chasing deadlines, always short-staffed, and everyone seems to be complaining about something. I know it’s part of the agency world, but sometimes it feels like we’re just firefighting all day.\n\nAnother thing I’ve noticed is that sometimes we’re asked to push certain products or “friendly” publishers due to internal agreements, which can make me feel a bit powerless or limited in doing what’s *actually* best for performance. I’m curious — for those of you working in big network agencies, especially in Europe, do you experience the same kind of politics or “preferred partner” pressure?\n\nAs for salary, I’m earning more than I did before, but from what I’ve heard, it’s still not particularly high compared to other roles in media. My plan is to treat this as a learning experience — kind of a training ground to grow my skills and hopefully progress in my career.\n\nWould love to hear if anyone else has gone through something similar or has advice on how to make the most out of this kind of environment.\n\nThanks!",

Is it learning how to consult with clients? Is it media excellence, is it \\*business\\* knowledge?\n\nTo get the most out of agency, you have to take a step back and really focus on what your \\*role\\* is in the business, and also understand how that role ladders up to what is really a giant money making machine.\n\nI've just finished 5 years and am getting out of agency now, but it's the place that has taught me more than I ever could have imagined. The real key is just figuring out how to make it work for you, and stopping every now and then to take stock of what you've learned.\n\nMore recently, I've gotten behind the scenes of how agencies make money, and, it's not pretty.\n\nTwo answer your two biggest questions\n\nThe pace and resource problem, big learning for me was, always ask yourself \"is this what my client asked for?\". Never add complexity to a process or solution, without there being commercial benefit. ie, if you pull together an advanced presentation for a client that they didn't ask for, then have a think about the trade off there. Yes it might be the best solution, but are you or the agency getting commercial benefit from that? Or would the more basic solution deliver comparable results, without adding complexity to process. When analysing your clients issues, tackle the low effort, high reward problems first, and move from there. Same goes in your internal processes, what small changes can have the largest impact?\n\nThose publisher biases you talk about, have a re-think about what optimal look likes. If your agency has $1million committed to a publisher, and that commitment helps unlock a 20% discount agency wide on a market rate, then your contribution to that commitment, \\*is\\* directly benefiting your client. The value in agencies is pooling spend to unlock efficiency. So when you're comparing Publisher A vs Publisher B, and one is an 95th percentile solution, and one is a 90th percentile solution, ask yourself if that 5 percentile points is worth \\*not\\* contributing to the agency deal, and helping preserve that favorable rate position for all clients.\n\nAll in all, agencies can be absolutely awful at times, but just focus on what \\*you\\* are learning. There's so much to learn, and so much of it is incredibly valuable for your journey, just make sure you're conscious what you're getting out of it.",

This has been reliable data in both other ad platforms like Meta as well as off-line.\n\nWhen I upload to Stackadapt, however, it shows people as being all over the country (and the world) to an extent that VPNs or people moving can't explain. Only about half of the matched audience is showing as actually in the state of MN, let alone the municipality I'm interested in. When I use the forecasting tool and target only that municipality, only a fraction of those people are in the city the data says they should be. I tried running a campaign to see if was just a glitch with these previewing tools, but the results have been a slow trickle which indicates to me that the large majority people who are on my list are not getting targeted.\n\nAny idea what is going wrong? I've double checked the file requirements, compared my uploaded list to the data in NGPVAN to see if things somehow got jumbled, made sure my bids are competitive, but no luck so far.\n\n[Stackadapt's geo placements for my all-MN audience.](https://preview.redd.it/zp4cjrsulwwf1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=10628c97c7948fd1011c60a2bf55d641ad7ba595)\n\n",

We're talking about the real drama too... Like how their empire of click fraud operates and how the government protects them because they spy on the entire planet for them.

They've proven that they can not be trusted under any circumstances...\n\nSo, they used their lies about trying to fix their tech, to prevent competition by trolling us? Sigh man... This stuff has to stop dude...\n\nI'm serious: A few years ago I made the hard decision to never work with that company again in any capacity and my life has gotten a lot better since then... I'm very serious about that... They're not making the world a better place or close to it.\n\nI mean seriously, I went from search optimization, to search tech, to ad tech, and now I'm moving on to something else.

It’s designed to let marketers plan campaigns, create branded content, and launch ads, all without going through an agency.\n\nAccording to their announcement, Open Pro has three parts:\n\n* Plan: Use AI trained on WPP’s data to build campaign strategies and audience insights.\n* Create: Auto-generate brand-safe creative using tools like Google’s Veo, OpenAI’s Sora, and Adobe Firefly \n* Publish: Either push content straight to ad platforms or route through WPP’s Open Media Studio.\n\nPricing is usage-based after an initial access fee, so it’s structured more like a software platform than an agency engagement.\n\n  \nWhen WPP hired Cindy Rose from Microsoft earlier this year, it signaled a shift from services to platforms. Rose helped lead Microsoft’s transition from a product company to a full-fledged platform business, and it seems she’s now trying to apply the same strategy at WPP.\n\nWPP Open is starting to look like Salesforce for advertising:\n\n* Smaller brands and in-house teams can pay for access to WPP’s AI tools.\n* Agencies might license their data clean room or creative automation features.\n* WPP stops competing for smaller clients and starts extracting value from the entire ad supply chain.\n\nThis could mark a major turning point for holding companies. Instead of acting as service providers, they’re evolving into infrastructure that others in the industry depend on.\n\nIn some ways, it’s a new approach, but also a familiar one. We’ve seen similar attempts before, back when trading desks first appeared in the early 2010s.\n\nSo I’ve got a few questions:  \n\\- Could WPP really pull off a Microsoft-style transformation?  \n\\- Will it eat into the potential income of smaller independent agencies?",

So I wonder how I can start working on implementing this website with oRTB and other SSPs (PubMatic, BidSwitch, Appnexus, Rubicon, Pulsepoint, Freewheel). \n4) I assume integrations are most commonly done by the developers, if that's the case, what this role expects me to do. I've searched a lot, but I haven't been able to wrap my head around the end to end approach that someone in the integration role would do. \n\nAny help would do wonders!\n\n\nDescription:\n•Own supply integrations via Header Bidding, ORTB protocol, and RTB/PMP. • Lead SSP onboarding, managing endpoints, tags, and feeds with accuracy. \n• Manage DSP onboarding, ensuring compatibility and smooth daily operations (PubMatic, BidSwitch, etc.).\n• Oversee end-to-end ad operations and publisher account management across CTV, Video, Display, and In-App.\n• Audit publisher integrations to ensure data integrity, fraud detection, fill rates, and error resolution.\n\nThanks for your time:)",

These ads include discounts of up to 60% that can only be accessed through the ad URL.\n\nAs a user, I would normally click an ad like that (if only to not lose the discount URL), so it’s odd to see people supposedly converting without clicking.\n\nI was looking at the “Time To Conversion” metric to get a sense of the delay between the impression and the conversion, but the UI doesn’t specify any units — I can’t tell if it’s in days, hours, or something else, and the documentation isn’t clear either.\n\nHas anyone experienced similar behavior? Is this kind of post-view inflation normal for DV360 retargeting?  \nAlso, what’s the best way to confirm that the impressions truly come from DV360 and not from another channel that might be firing the same Floodlight tag?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights.\n\n\n\n",

Attribution is a very complecated and deep branch of marketing, not a topic to be closed with 'I would normally click an ad'.\n\n  \nOverall, your post contains many presumptions that you may not even be aware of.

Are you really asking if there is somebody who knows you are running a campaign via DV360, is reapeadetly creating new cookies to be caught by rtg setup in DV360, and then goes to the website to PURCHASE something?

      "content": "Hi community, \n\nSince April, was running 2 simultaneous campaigns for a streaming platform client that offers subscription to stream NHL and MLB. \n\nThe landing page and checkout flow is the same for both campaigns; creatives in each campaign are sport-specific.\n\nOn a floodlight level, i track the type of membership purchased via custom variables, but there is no data piece to indicate whether the subscription was purchased to watch hockey or baseball specifically. \n\nThis past spring, NHL campaign (Stanley cup finals) had much larger budgets and much higher paid& organic volume of subscriptions. \n\nWhile Hockey was on, the MLB campaign was attributing conversions as well through retargeting, contextual sports targeting, affinity segments tactics. I imagine that for DV360, it could be that theres not much difference between baseball and hockey fans. \n\nCPA in MLB campaign was great until the day after the Stanley Cup was over. subscriptions idried up the day after - and for the next 3 months I could not make the campaign perform. Tactics that worked well while hockey was on, had a 10x increase in CPA. \n\nIn my opinion, the volume of Hockey-skewed data messed up the bidder in the Baseball campaign since: \n\n* large volume hockey visitors converted and got attributed to baseball campaign via retargeting/broad sports targeting \n\n* algos/bidder kept intaking audience and placement signals that worked while Hockey was on and trying to find users similar to those that converted in April-May. \n\n\n\nSo, my questions are: \n\n* how do you think i can go about minimizing cross attribution given that the client wont build separate landing pages per sport and 90% of conversions are post-view\n\n* how do you feel about my theory of feeding wrong data signals to the bidder for 3 months, which made it basically impossible to recover and find a new audience (baseball audience) after? \n\n\nCurious to hear your answers!

You can then use this in the next point\n* DV360 Custom Bidding may be useful in this situation vs optimising purely to the Floodlight on its own\n* Assuming there are other pages on the website specific to MLB / NHL, you can do something smart with 1st party cookies to tie this to the final purchase as a custom variable, to somewhat infer what the user may use the subscription for.

I assume that a big chunk of converted users \"attributed\" to MLB campaign were also actually hockey fans, who got served an ad from the MLB campaign as they were browsing a relevant website. \n\nI have a theory that all these conversions, which most likely were hockey fans, really messed up DV360's bidder as for 2.5 months. Incorrect data signal was being fed to the bidder and it couldn't re-configure itself as the hockey demand has dried up. \n\n  \nThinking about it now, I wonder if creating new line items from scratch in DV360 would sort of \"reset\" the bidder and let it learn anew.\n\n  \nWhat are your thoughts on that? I wish I could discuss this internally with other agency folks, but it feels like noone is running performance campaigns, so noone is concerned about cross-contamination, floodlight setup, and data signal integrity.",

      "content": "In some ways, Amazon is playing a dirty but brilliant game.\n\nOn one side, Amazon’s offering agencies free head-to-head tests pitting its DSP directly against competitors like The Trade Desk, literally covering all costs (inventory, tech, measurement, etc.) for 4–6 week campaigns.\n\nIt’s an aggressive move to prove Amazon’s DSP outperforms others. The Trade Desk’s CMO Ian Colley called the tests “unfair,” arguing that Amazon performs well mainly because it directs spend toward its own properties rather than the open web.\n\nBut on the other side of the battlefield, AWS is getting defensive.  \nAs Google Cloud has been offering incentives and compute credits to lure ad tech companies over, AWS risked losing one of its most data-heavy verticals.\n\nNow it’s countering with RTB Fabric, a new real-time bidding infrastructure built inside AWS.\n\nIf two partners are on AWS within the same data center, they can communicate in microseconds instead of milliseconds, drastically cutting latency and networking costs (reportedly by up to 80%).\n\nThis aligns with AWS’s broader philosophy of “plug-and-play” openness, modularity, decentralization, and interoperability.\n\nRTB Fabric isn’t an open marketplace by itself but it fits right into that infrastructure mindset, giving ad tech firms more flexibility and control than Google’s more closed, vertically integrated ecosystem.\n\nThat last point matters.  \nGoogle is no longer seen as a “safe” infrastructure partner, not just because of competition, but due to mounting antitrust scrutiny. Many ad tech firms are understandably hesitant to run their operations on the same stack owned by a company being investigated for ad market dominance.\n\nAWS, by contrast, can credibly present itself as a more neutral infrastructure provider. even if everyone knows Amazon has its own motives.\n\nAnd there’s another layer:  \nas AI takes over ad tech, infrastructure needs will explode. The compute, data processing, and real-time modeling required for AI-driven ad optimization all funnel directly into AWS’s core business. That’s a built-in growth opportunity:  every AI advancement in ad tech drives more demand for AWS infrastructure.\n\nSo wdyt, is Amazon playing this right?",

So far, I’ve had the best response through **Amazon DSP** and **DV360**, running campaigns between **6–11pm**. I even got tagged in a few local Facebook groups where residents mentioned seeing my streaming TV ad which was great to see. Honestly, I think I might be one of the only small businesses in my area (or maybe even the state) doing any kind of programmatic advertising.\n\nI’ve also tested **DOOH**, including **in-theater ads** (about 20 theaters for two weeks — zero response), **screens in gyms, grocery stores, and retail** (also zero), and **digital billboards** via **Admatx (The Trade Desk)** targeting two local Lamar signs. The signs were impossible to miss — one-lane each way, 40mph road — but after a month (5pm–7pm rotation), I saw no measurable response.\n\n**YouTube Instant Guaranteed** got plenty of views but no noticeable leads. \n\nI also ran an **audio campaign** on Admatx across multiple platforms for two weeks, again zero response.\n\nAt this point, it really seems like **streaming TV** is the clear winner for local brand recognition. People notice it, comment on it, and we get actual leads from it. Sure, I could keep testing DOOH or audio for a few more months, but if one channel is delivering consistent awareness and results, it makes sense to double down there.\n\nThat said, I’m really curious, for those who work with **local businesses**, what ad types or strategies have you found to be most effective in generating real leads/sales?\n\nHappy to share more about all the tools and DSPs I’ve used if anyone’s interested.

If you toggle cross-device concept to off, every conversion moving forward will not be measured via cross device. If you change the vendor from identiy alliance to adbrain, every conversion after the change will be measured only using adbrain's graph. They are 4 total providers, with liveramp being the only option that is more expensive, Identity alliance combines all 3 providers providing more scale (at least im pretty sure thats how it was explained to me). Although I'm pretty sure TTD doesn't charge for measurement, only for audience expansion, but looking at the fees section they may have changed this now.\n\nHonestly, what i would do is create a new reporting column with the same conversion action, not set any cross device measurement on there and compare over time. you'll likely see more conversions in the reporting column with identity alliance turned on. but if you don't, then you'll know that it's likely a feature not worth paying for in future campaigns.\n\nJust be warned that changing reporting columns mid campaign gets really messy and could really screw up your reporting, so I wouldn't change any existing reporting columns unless you're confident you can mitigate any ill effect.",

I have recently found myself in a company that has 0 understanding of programmatic and only do direct deals for their gambling affiliated display content. As part of my new remit they want me to prove the value of programmatic by capitalising on around 270 million unfilled impressions worldwide. \n\nI have been able to set up an ad server / SSP (GAM), implemented some fairly standard ad sizes, mobile banner, top leaderboard, MPU's etc and have also implemented some KVP's for ATF/BTF and ad placement. However the fill rate currently is still very low around 5% with a £0.90 floor price. As I have never really worked in optimising delivery, I am asking if anyone has some helpful advice that could aid in filling the inventory space more consistently (was hoping for 50-60%)? I have a vague understanding of yield groups and could potentially look at utilising other SSP's to open up to more advertising traffic. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated for a newbie in this space!",
