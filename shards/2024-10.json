I am running a DV360 YouTube auction campaign (VRC with only YouTube selected as inventory) at around $20-30k monthly. \n\nI’ve pulled placement reports and am noticing we are clearing on YouTube TV inventory (networks) that aligns really well with what we are buying on the Linear TV, but only a small portion of the budget maybe $1k a month. I assume it’s just luck of the draw if YT TV has an inventory spot to fill they pull from live VRC campaigns.\n\nQuestion: My client is obviously interested in seeing how to push more of our VRC buy to YT TV because the CPMs are comparable to linear $2-4 but they only way to buy YT TV is through instant reserve deals which have us quoted around $25 for a YT TV select RON and my client hyper focuses on CPMs so that’s a no go for him.\n\nHas anyone had success with rigging a VRC to favor YT TV inventory in the auction?

Better to have the agency keep their financial details in the accounts if possible, so that if they erroneously overspend by loads it’s both their fault and their issue with creditors.  \n  \nYou may then want to consider linking the ad account with your other Google properties, like Google Analytics 4 and a YouTube channel, which can be useful for retargeting and providing Pmax campaigns with purchase/lead data as an audience signal to empower its machine learning capabilities.",

If its a multi-day process they might also be digging into theoretical scenarios, like \"What would you do if...\", personality tests, or thought experiments, like \"How much does this building weigh\". I'm not the biggest fan of the last two, they have rightly been phased out of a lot of hiring processes, but are still pretty common. \n\nThat doesn't rule out specific questions on programmatic infrastructure, depending on how knowledgeable the recruiters are, but I think the important thing to do is be able to concisely explain the experience in each job on your CV and how it relates to the position you're going for.

I just block inventory outright and do not use bid factors. It's a waste of time.\n* Look at ad environment and device type. I use bid factors here but only bid down. 9/10 times I block in-app inventory. Story of my programmatic life.\n* shift budget around to best performing audience\n\nThen keep doing that on a weekly cadence\n\nAfter 30 days\n\n* pull a conversion details report if available (it is in TTD). find the average # of impressions it takes to convert. look at your campaign frequency and adjust based on those numbers\n* look at creative versions (not ad formats). remove lower performing creative versions, and get more cycled in in 60-90 days\n\nI ignore geo, ad formats, time of day, basically anything else.\n\nIf not pacing okay:\n\n* add additional audience segments that are relevant to your original target audience. This is the only way to really add scale without changing the PMPs.\n* Or, you adjust fcaps. If you're only targeting 1x per day/week, it's very likely that your not even penetrating your target audience well enough anyway for them to even know to make a conversion. Serve them more ads.\n\nAnother thing to open up inventory is looking at viewability. If it is in the 80-90% range, be open to moving it down to the 70% range. I've lowkey found that highly viewable placements does not equal more conversions. Like a lot people ignore top of the fold ads, especially if they are reading an article. Even though a placement has a higher average viewable %, it doesn't mean its impactful.\n\nOther things to consider, How many average conversions happen on the site per day? might be that there just isn't that much activity on the site and you have an unattainable goal.",

If you onboard your data to Xandr, and target those audiences in a deal, you may see higher match rates because you’re further upstream and seeing more bid requests.  A lot of decisions are made by various systems before your campaign submits a bid on a request, and you may have missed out on your particular user without knowing it.\n\nLook up 1P audience targeting through SSPs, and you’ll probably find a lot of info (and fluff lol) that explains the benefits.",

In short I create the seats for the agencies or direct clients, help the company understand what they can do with programmatic ads, deliver the campaigns, and report on them. \n\nSo I would say, yes it can be a great model, however I would advise against working with resellers and maybe try to get your own DSPs seats on Tier 2 or 3 DSPs which are still perfectly valid (in my opinion even better as they are often specialised on 1-2 formats) and run the activities from there. \n\nBarriers to start are quite brutal I have to say but once you start having a stable client base, it is, in my opinion the best side to be on in the market. You are always fully aligned with your clients and can deliver value while only doing the most fun part of the media trader role. :) \n\nHope that helps!\n\nCompany is [https://tedjordan.org](https://tedjordan.org) if some of you are wondering.",

This delay seems excessive, and I’m curious how it affects your operations:\n\n1. **How significant is this delay**? Does the lack of immediate revenue create cash flow issues, especially before you establish a steady stream of income?\n2. **After the initial 120-day period**, when revenue becomes more predictable, does this delay still impact your business, or is it less of a concern?\n3. If quicker payment options existed (even at a slight discount), would this be something you’d consider to improve liquidity?\n\n**Edit:** Realised I didn’t explain the quick payment angle properly - sorry for any confusion. So let’s say there are investors willing to take on some risk. Think of a setup where a group of investors steps in, buys up ad inventory for a set period (say, 6 months), and pays the publisher upfront (obv only doing it if there’s money to be made). For those 6 months, the ad impression revenue goes straight to the holders. This way, publishers hedge their revenue stream, dodge the cash flow crunch, and sort out the working capital problem.",

Of course when you get paid quickly, your liquidity is better, but Pubs are working with dozens of partners at a time and one bad link can break the chain. \n\nWhen it comes to paying Publishers, you are looking at SSPs or direct to agency/advertiser. SSPs default to n60 or n90 but this is negotiable and ive gotten plenty down to n30. They get paid by the DSP, Agency, Advertiser who has some other n60-n120 on them. Big guys like Google or Magnite have cash and can float you, others are scrambling to reconcile behind the scenes. \n\nGoing direct to a pub, advertisers/agencies usually have a much longer timeline, n90-n120, likely bc they are waiting for the client cash.

The media runs and then the billing cycle starts:\n\nPublisher issues invoice to platform or agency.\n\nIf a platform, then the platform has to then invoice the agency.\n\nThe agency then needs to verify that the invoice is correct, that delivery actually happened, that there is proof of performance, and that it matches a purchase authorization from the client and the purchase authorization from the agency. \n\nThe agency then needs to Bill the client/brand for the media that ran plus the agency's work in managing it. \n\nEvery step of the way has 30 days of payment terms attached to it. So at the very minimum republishers looking at 90 days in a perfect world. 120 days is more realistic. \n\nThen imagine you're some huge international brand and that your contract with the agency says that you will only pay your invoices from the agency in net 180 days. You have that negotiating power because you're spending millions and millions of dollars with the agency and you'd rather hold your money and invest it than pay invoices in 30 days. \n\nI'm not saying any of this is okay. I'm just saying this is how media procurement works and why it takes so long for publishers to get paid at the end of the day. \n\nAnd we haven't even gotten into invoices that don't match delivery or the purchase authorizations or clients that go out of business and don't end up paying... All this can extend payment periods even longer.\n\nYou can offer the agency discounts for paying early, but the reality is they don't have the money to do that and they're not willing to take the risk in the interim while the client pays them.

Or is it more that, even with these terms, publishers avoid the hassle of litigation unless absolutely necessary?\n\nAlso, curious to get your take on big publishers like FT. they’re not just relying on ad revenue; a lot of their cash flow is probably coming from subscriptions. Do you think they’d be open to faster payment terms (say within 10 days) if they had to take a discount? So say after the initial burn period, the publisher's cash flow starts stabilising with a predictable stream they can count on to keep ops running. Does that upfront payment in 10 days really bring much to the table? Why would a publisher sell off ad slots at a discount when they could just sit tight, wait the n120, and pocket the full amount?

In that market, you’ve got plenty of investors and speculators who arent the actual producers or end users of the commodity yet they are willing to take a position because theres enough liquidity and a secondary market. Ad inventory could follow a similar path if a market with decent liquidity develops. If it turns into a recognised asset class with some level of predictable valuation, you'd likely see traders stepping in. ATM i think only the ad tech players know how to price it out, but if the market takes off, I expect others from outside coming in, seeing value in it for diversification or even short-term gain or even for pure speculation. took me some time to process and accept it-if there’s money on the table, there’ll always be someone ready to YOLO it.",

I have a solid understanding of the programmatic ecosystem, including DSPs, SSPs, ad exchanges, and data management platforms.\n\nHowever, I'm always looking to learn more and increase my earning potential. I'm particularly interested in part-time remote positions in the UK or US that could supplement my income.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on:\n\n - Advanced Programmatic Techniques: Are there any specific skills or certifications that could help me command higher salaries? I'm only familiar with GMP and my expertise lies mostly with DV360. \n\n - Freelancing Opportunities: How can I effectively market myself as a freelance programmatic expert? I know getting DV360 access may only be possible via agencies or connecting with partners-- But how do I get in touch with them? And also if the situation could be different with other DSPs? \n\n - Remote Job Boards or Networks: Where should I focus my job search for high-paying remote roles?\n\nI'm really disappointed with how much I make and the impact I have on organisations so any insights or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

I have been in programmatic for 3 years now and still paid crappy despite independently managing nearly £1M average per quarter for the last couple quarters for this fashion retailer. \n\nI am not sure about advanced techniques but if you can take the basics and help client drive incremental value then you’ll definitely be seen as knowledgeable. For example I worked with this retailer’s in-house CDP team to help create relevant 1pa audiences, activated programmatically and talked about how this provided cross-selling value, grow LTV and also how this would help with their OKRs. For example they had lots of purchasers purchasing products from specific brands only, we targeted them to also consider other similar brands we sell. \n\nOn freelancing, I have the same questions as you but assume yes some mid to large size agencies might need help with complex builds so they could potentially reach out to someone on fiverr. \n\nFor the job hunting bit, if you keep your profile open to recruiters only on LinkedIn, I am sure you can get interviews to some high paying jobs.",

We use 1st party data from our access as the internet service provider to 30 million homes + 3rd party data (70+ data partners) to find, reach, and measure audiences across linear television viewing on cable networks as well as streaming TV viewing across linear/CTV/Mobile/Tablet.  \n  \nAs a local market sales manager, i'm primarily selling/running managed service campaigns through direct insertion orders.  In the last couple years i've seen a growing number of clients/ad agencies becoming savvier with their buying approaches, setting up seats at DSPs like MNTN, TTD, StackAdapt, Basis, etc.\n\nWith Linear Pay TV subs & linear TV budgets in decline, along with the continued shift into CTV budgets + programmatic approach on the rise, I've started to consider if it's a good time to make a career switch into working for a DSP to become more well rounded for what the next 5-10 years in the industry will look like.\n\nWould love to get advice/input from this community on things like: \n\n \\- what DSP would be best to transition into from a \"legacy\" media like linear pay TV media sales?   \n \\- Am I crazy to think I could add value to a DSP sales organization with my background?    \n \\- If not, what aspects of coming from a company like Spectrum Reach could i leverage?  \n \\- What roles would make for the best transition?  Assuming sales as that's my current role but perhaps I'm missing something about needing to start with a different role for the transition?  \n",

While, I do think this is correct, but my concern was on ad collision and exhaustion. Hence, my recommendation was to set frequency cap and monitor the “frequency limited” impression lost chart and optimize accordingly.\n\nEspecially considering the fact that my client is selling home appliances which the product prices are not that cheap. Thinking from the user’s perspective, I would find it annoying to have to see multiple ads at the same time. \n\nAdditionally, we run the campaigns globally which consists of countries with huge audience pool and inventories like India and Indonesia.\n\nCould you let me know which option would be better?\n\nDo let me know if you require more info!",

By not setting a limit, you’re feeding the algorithm more data about the requests you’re willing to bid on, that will hopefully lead to a winning bid.  Bidders care more about learning which opportunities will lead to a winning bid than delivering thoughtful advertising.\n\nThe DSP won’t learn from the conversion pixel, i.e. it won’t analyze how many times the user was exposed before they triggered a pixel fire.  Instead, it will learn the profile of the user that triggers the pixel fire, and will try to bid more on those types of users.  It does potentially shorten the number of exposures for a conversion, but may still result to overexposure.\n\nIf I was running a campaign purely for learnings, I’d not add a cap.

Recently, I disabled Enhanced Attribution in CM, and since then, our CTR has nearly doubled across all campaigns, creatives, tactics, and regions. What’s even more surprising is that the number of invalid clicks, which we monitor using a 3P tool, has dropped by up to 10x. No other changes have been made to the campaign setup — nothing new launched or paused.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar? Any ideas on why this might be happening?",
