However, the overall process of creating them is a bit frustrating and slow as we need to involve multiple team members designers, copywriters & engineers.  \nIf you are also using advertorials, how do you go about them?

The content currently lives on YouTube and on their web platform via dedicated video player and we are looking to maximize the library via CTV. It’s really solid output, it’s entirely owned by the publisher, and is targeting a sought after audience. It can also easily be reconfigured/packaged (so to speak) to live in a CTV space.\n\nWith that, I’m keen to know - from a publisher standpoirnt - where does one start when it comes to seeding their content onto CTV?\n\nAre there any leading networks/agencies that one could / should approach to place their content on?\n\nDo such platforms exist or is it a case of building one’s own channel and plugging in adverting ala display? \n\nAdmittedly a bit of a novice on the topic, but from what I’ve seen there’s the options of launching one’s own channel and the option placing content on an existing network’s channel. Given the newness of the venture and lack of assurances of scalability, the latter is definitely preferred. \n\nVery nearly onboarded onto one of the networks we work with who were, themselves, veering into the CTV space. But the contract was quite rigid and restrictive and, in being a new platform in and of itself, didn’t come with much assurance of revenue.\n\nI guess, in essence, the primary ask is: who are the key players in the space when it comes to taking on premium content and ensuring it delivers solid revenue for the publisher. \n\nThe goal, in all transparency, is to have their video library work “for” them. Both from an incremental revenue standpoint and from the standpoint of display being so unpredictable that there’s a need more than ever to diversity revenue streams.\n\nAny insights / assistance would be greatly appreciated.",

A Top of the Pops-like setup for instance that would be branded as the publisher's \"Show\" on the network's \"Channel.\"\n\nAs I understand it, they would wrap the pre-roll, mid-roll, and post-roll around the content and that is how the publisher makes the rev. \n\nTheir angle was that they were the ones tasked with pushing their channel and had all these deals in place to help ensure the content would be seen and thus earn the pubs rev.\n\nWe didn't go with them in the end, but that setup appeals in that it simply lets the pubs use their existing video library to make more rev without the need for much maneuvering or manpower. With the already rocky roads of display etc, for the size of pubs I'm referencing (mid), it feels way more appealing/advantageous to onboard a moving train than having to build out their own (re CTV). \n\nAny insights on how to go about achieving this or the established players that operate in the way outlined (e.g. accepting premium content of this ilk) would be greatly appreciated.",

      "content": "I see a lot of questions here about whitelisting and blacklisting.\n\nAlso, I think that quality is one of the biggest concerns in our industry. I've audited tons of different campaigns and inventory was (almost) always a case - traders target 20+ SSP, resellers, web+app, don't use allowlists etc. This all leads to significant budgets spent on MFAs, long tail sites, and ultimately, lower campaign performance and issues with brand safety\n\n\\*I have a detailed guide about Inventory optimization (Blacklisting and whitelisting) as well as a checklist - here is the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MAaEtXirpUs5uHGetFGYTkWmRD1-4weW/view?usp=sharing) (guide), [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TbOAyL9U0Cxfx97_iylUALQHiI8BcISlOzzQ4wmruow/edit?usp=sharing) (checklist)\n\nBut if you want to fix it quickly, there are two ways:\n\n1. Blacklist - low level of effort, but also low effectiveness. New MFA sites emerge daily, so you can't catch them all in real-time;\n\n2. Whitelist - a higher level of effort - but effectiveness is significantly higher. I recommend using your existing data (app/url or site report) and making a standard URL analysis. Identify strict rules (aka filters) based on your KPI (i.e, CPA) and eliminate long-tail websites (there can be 60,000+ sites, which doesn't make sense); eliminate sites with 0 conversions; eliminate sites with higher than average CPA. Here we go - you got a list of websites that drove you conversions with affordable CPA. It will be the basis of your allowlist. Now, you need to verify them - and remove low-quality and MFA sites (yes, that can 'drive' conversions, by just attributing last touch) - I recommend you check traffic sources of those sites (i.e if organic traffic is low this is a bad sign), also check number ads on the webpage, ads.txt and etc. After all of that - congrats, you can apply it to your campaigns\n\nBut if you want to be 100% sure in your inventory - you need to do a proper supply path optimization and do the same with your supply vendors (SSPs).\n\n",

Trying to stay on top of this, amongst all the other priorities unfortunately is one of those tasks that gets pushed back on the to-do list, but you should aim to refresh and review this once a year when your client(s) downtime might be",

As a first step, I'd recommend you check that the max bid is above all deal floor prices, if that's the case you must separate the deals in different lines. That should enable you to trigger spend through all lines, might need to leverage fixed bidding first, but gives the algo's learning to start with before using optimized bids.

Did you have any specific story at your company and used the STAR method to portray it and if so what was it? Programmatic obviously has a lot of different lanes so would love any advice you guys can give to really impress the hiring managers (for either account manager roles/trading specialist roles)\n\n  \nThanks in advance!",

Is there a way to make these URLs MRAID-compliant for in-app environments?\n\nIf I’m using Next.js and standard JavaScript, would you suggest starting by directly implementing the MRAID JavaScript functions provided in the spec? Or would it be better to wrap this functionality in a custom library to handle permissions and events smoothly?\n\nAlso, do you have any recommendations for testing MRAID ads on actual devices, given the differences in permissions/access across devices?

You don't need to execute any of that code, but simply add it to the creative and make sure it's loaded. This is a critical test to check that SSPs/DSPs or their (f*ing) Ad Verification tools won't block your ads because of those scripts.\n3- highly recommended you host any code on your servers and use a legit domain (forget cloudflare urls or even a freshly acquired domain). This is to prevent the issues that might arise as described in 2.\n\nHope it'll help and look fwd to see some nice enriched ads!",

My quick thought is it's a symptom of how software companies are run now, with so few product managers, and so many engineers who have little responsibility outside of completing tickets on a board. The product managers are in charge of 100 features and keeping new sales and higher ups happy, and there's no person who is empowered to make sure pacing is firing on all cylinders.\n\nThere should be someone in charge of pacing who wakes up in the morning and is like OK how are we gonna make pacing better today? It's that important IMO.\n\nI've recently been getting back into the CTV game at work and have been working with a lot of folks using SpringServe and Publica, and have found it fairly interesting. I haven't seen much new on the demand side but I am somewhat isolated now.

Is anyone familiar with a self serve platform with low campaign minimums that offers Amazon audio or OLV?  Or a partner agency that would accept small buys?  My Amazon local AE has not been helpful.\n\nThanks. ",

Then decide to roll with an Agency going forward or pursure being on a DSP yourself.  \n\nDownside to running programmatic direct really comes down to how good your support team is. And how much you have to spend. For like $30k of spend per month you might not get an A team from mid-size DSP but you will have a good amount of options. \n\nIf you are interested in chatting more - hit me up. Our agency would be a great resource but I can at least give you some ideas of which DSPs would be worth pursuing on your own at that budget level.",

I'm with a programmatic platform that is integrated with the top 15 DSPs - simultaneously.  Meaning, a single campaign fluidly travels across all DSPs such as TTD, DV360, Yahoo, Meta, AMZN, Spotify, Vistar, and many more - while the AI optimizes in real-time, and aggregates the best performing pockets from each DSP into a single unified campaign.  We're using the strengths of many DSPs, vs just one.  Plenty of reporting and visualizations to show performance of each DSP, who's contributing, where, and how.  Nobody else is doing this.  We're outperforming the same stand-alone DSPs we're integrated with, and crushing 'Meta DSPs' and 'resellers', as they're still manual and take very high margins.\n\nDM me with any interest.

My specialty is in running a team of specialists and overseeing execution and reporting.\n\nDue to shifting currency exchange rate and market situations, I find myself looking for a US-based role where I can work remotely. Seriously, being a specialist for a US company will pay me more than being a manager for a Canadian company!\n\nIs anyone looking to hire a competent Canadian for a role that one can work remotely, or know a recruiter? Please send me a DM and we can chat more about my qualifications and what I bring to the table.\n\nThank you!",

I personally have a media trading agency and whenever I see agencies offer this sort of payment model what that means is:  \n“We are performant only in post-view so if your brand is making a lot of organic sales we will make money out of you using the CPA and rev share part, otherwise we loose nothing with the impression payment”  \nI would honestly refuse this proposal. Either they commit to a CPA or rev share fully, or they go fully for impression. Regardless, 60 days post view is a joke I have to say  ( most DSPs cannot even keep the user data for more than 30 days so it means optimizing on CPM more than anything…)Your best bet probably is to research more and maybe try to understand it by yourself maybe with a consultant or freelance?!Hope that helps ;)",

These sites often face unique challenges, such as maximizing revenue without compromising user experience or implementing ads without affecting game performance.\n\nMy question is: what are the most effective solutions these companies offer for H5 game site owners? For instance, ad formats (video, interstitial, rewarded), revenue optimization strategies, or technical support.\n\nAdditionally, I’d love insights on:\n\n* What key details should you consider when choosing a monetization partner?\n* Are there pitfalls or practices to avoid when working with these companies?\n* Tips for integrating ads without frustrating players?\n\nIf you’ve worked with any of these companies or have experience in this space, please share your thoughts! The more detailed, the better—it’ll help me understand how these partnerships work in practice.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",
