Iris provides the different CTV broadcasters with their unique Iris ID per show which can be passed in the bid-stream of most DSPs and SSPs. These IrisIDs then correspond to the assigned contextual segment to ensure you're then running on only the content you wanted to target contextually.

It would be a unique advantage for a buying team to have someone else join their team who has been working closely with buyers on supply side. The bidding strategy comes with practice, sure, but it’s important to have experience within different parts of the ecosystem rather than a singular, traditional buying background. Planning is a huge part of the success of buyers. The granular nature of some of these job qualifications in ad tech are giving me a headache.

It all stems from the almost complete lack of training media agencies provide to their staff.",

I am 100% confident that renting a fur suit and waving a sign around is more cost effective in almost all cases... I mean if you want attention, then you gotta work for it. This low effort stuff is really old and ultra tired at this point. We're like 15  years past the hayday and people are still just piling into the same products, that just cost more and more due to the bidding nature of the products...",

Yikes, I think the consensus is that Google is a monopoly that is going to do whatever they want and whether you like it or not is too bad. It's not doing anything that a human being can't do and a human being with experience should be many times more effective, so I would say no. I don't see how it's possible that a consensus of people think that. I mean maybe if you compare \"out of the box\" campaign settings... If you actually set the campaigns up intelligently, then no, how is that possible?\n\nWhat does \"performance\" even mean? Like it makes Google more money than other DSPs? Yeah for sure... I'm sure that people \"stumbling\" into display advertising with zero experience performs extremely well for Google... If you're talking about cost effectiveness, then absolutely not. I would say that depends on the media buyer and their skills. Which, apparently people don't value skills and would rather have an AI that is usually wrong do it for them. You can just let the algorithm bid on placements that a human knows to avoid... I don't know why anybody thinks that a good idea... You know, besides Google...\n\nYou know, usually the way this process starts is by analyzing the customers and their interests, then making a list of placements where it would make logical sense to have ads there...

Enticing ad buyers I'm sure can be a challenge at times depending on the site and what the offers are. If there's not much differentiation from targeting inventory through DSP platforms, why would you pay higher CPMs to buy direct? You wouldn't most likely so what are some of the things website owners and online media companies can offer to get you to say \"yes\" to buying direct? This can include categories like unique ad units, sponsorships, data, etc. Thanks for reading!",

There is not a lot of decisioning made by the ad server except for impression delivery. \n\nA buyer may also decide to go this route if it's part of a wider media plan with the publisher that can't be transacted through the DSP, attract favourable commercials like rebates or commissions or maybe the agency is tight on resources and cant manage the campaign.",

Some DSPs like TTD will be transparent about the margins, but they have minimums as well as other fees which can add up easily. Some others will include a lot of features but have an undisclosed variable-margin bid mechanism.\n\nI recommend that you should test 3-4 DSPs at the same time and see which platform gives you what you need the most, at the best price first. You may be surprised with the results since the obvious ones might not be the answer. This will help you identify targeting capabilities, available insights, recommended optimizations and support. Once you have the results, pick 2 of the platforms that closely align with the KPIs you are looking to hit.\n\nLastly, the volume of money you spend would give you room to negotiate. Once you know what your acquisition costs are, you can negotiate volume discounts on amount payable. I have negotiated similar margin contracts before where they get a 5% discount for spend over $ XX or 10% discount on payable over $ YY spend and so on. But this really works when you have a large budget. For smaller budgets or campaigns running with regionality, I do feel that having more features and better support goes much further than a pre-negotiated margin.",

Or want the UI to call out if there is a charge associated? Are you looking to see how much the DSP is making from everything? All DSPs obscure things to a degree but there is rarely a time where they are charging you for nothing. ex. Dv360 pushes more bids toward their owned SSP to make money on both sides of the impression. TTD has predictive clearing which will use platform wide bids to lower your bids to get the lowest price and takes a 25% fee on the savings you got. Both can save you money, but you have to pay a fee to get that.   \n  \n  \nI think your tech fee is going to be dependent on spend potential among other factors. Working for one of the larger DSPs, tech fee is flexible depending on portfolio size, region, sector, etc. The more budget/growth potential the more a DSP is willing to negotiate. If you have multiple DSPs it may seem like a positive but unless you have enough budget you could be missing out on massive savings. Furthermore it becomes hard to optimize performance when you have to juggle multiple DSPs. If you have 1st party data too, it can become costly to upload to multiple DSPs.\n\n  \nUltimately for performance buys, it sometimes pays more to pay more. DSPs all offer differing levels of support, tech, and features that make it hard to recommend without knowing your orgs specific needs. You can give rough recommendations, ex. Use the Google ecosystem for ad serving and need YouTube; DV360 is a good fit. Or have a lot of retail data and want to leverage exclusive data segments, Amazon might be best. But neither of these offer great support and troubleshooting, if you need best in class support, TTD is probably best.

Some of the more obvious examples would be adding a markup on tools, data and more that is offered in the platform. If you for example offer brand safety, audience data and other things then you can buy it for X CPM from those vendors and sell it for Y CPM with the difference being your margin. Or you might even buy it at a flat rate and sell it at a CPM to all your customers. A DSP could also get a lower CPM in from the SSP but sell at the same CPM as others (who get a higher CPM in). There could of course be a number of different ways revenue share is done between different companies in the ecosystem. Then you could have a number of other fees for anything from more advanced reporting data to support and more that is not clear when you sign up but once you need it down the road you find out. If the DSP is built on top of a white label platform they would in turn be paying a fee as well to another platform, like an indirect DSP fee.",

Don't lean into just a single mode of transacting. For most brands, you will see the best results with a mix of PG and PMP (biddable) tactics.

The more you break it down into detail the more control you can have over the settings of each group or line item. Downside, it will be more work to setup for sure. Upside, it will give more control over what device/audience pair gets a certain budget, bids etc. In terms of reporting you can separate this out afterwards so I don't see any benefits there. When I build ML models to find performance drivers for programmatic campaigns based on impression and performance data I usually work with one large data set and let the model do the hard work to find the good details in it. So I wouldn't say breaking the campaigns down into lots of ad groups would help with analytics. Probably more for operations, setup, budget allocation etc.",

It is nice to have increased control and performance insight in the UI when breaking out by device, but it is far easier to cut down on the targeting tactics and run ad groups across all devices. Suppose you have a mix of Desktop and Mobile creative sizes. In that case, I have seen instances where mobile-optimized creative is served in desktop environments, and breaking out ad groups by device can mitigate any issues there. TTD with Kokai introduced decisioning power, which performs better with broader ad groups, allowing AI to make more granular and informed decisions. By breaking ad groups out by device, you will limit the power that can be unlocked by reducing Koa's decisioning power.",

You gotta speak the language of the country you advertise in. Think Brand Safety, Premium Publishers, etc. Speaking the language is needed for that. Let alone dealing with clients. I had situations where clients simply switched from English to German to deal with the complexity of certain situations.\n\n\n3- Germany has other platforms for recruiting. You should check those.

There will be useful data there to inform your programmatic campaigns. For example look into the top smart bidding signals in Google Ads and see if they can help you get a head start with geo-targeting, time of day etc. Of course also look into current creatives to find current top performers. Consider A/B-testing of creatives. You can often get X multiples improvement from A/B-testing creatives by for example running multivariate tests. Use site inclusion lists. Try to find relevant publishers for the given audience. Don’t run with a blacklist and pre-bid filters like DV and IAS alone, you’ll get tons of bad traffic that way which will make your metrics a lot harder to achieve and many of those impressions and clicks will be garbage even if they are low cost (think advertising window replacements on a Hello Kitty game site however brand safe it might be).

Billboard CPMs are generally lower than the place based CPMs, it sounds like the difference might be attributed to \n\n1. **The agency likely making/suggesting a direct booking**. 9m imps for $16k  = $1.78 CPM before any margin. This is very low. I'd have to phone in some favors to get a rate that low. \\~$3 CPM direct is low but possible. Programmatic CPMs, depending on the venue type you need, will vary from $5 CPM = $25+CPMs\n\n2. **A venue type difference**. Did you only use Billboards in your forecast? The numbers are so different it seems unlikely to be a comparison of like for like. Smaller screens = smaller impression numbers because of the multiplier. I think this partly explains your lower imp forecast.\n\n3. **Ad server vs DSP**. Digital billboards running in an ad server, vs being bought programmatically can deliver many more impressions. Billboard publishers tend to operate a 60s loop. 6 ads displayed for 10s each, then looping back to the start. In a publisher ad server they can control and prioritize direct bookings over the programmatic spot in that loop, similar to an online pub ad server. \n\nAssuming 1 publisher here and that they have the avails to run the direct booking more often, they will , maybe 2 or 3 spots in that loop. vs the programmatic spot still only getting 1 spot in the loop and then you needing to win that programmatic spot auction. \n\nTL:DR - Your CPMs are a bit high, theirs are very low. It sounds like a direct booking in an ad server, so not like for like. You could tell them you're better as you can add data, attribution, fancy reporting dashboards, maybe throw in measurement for free.\n\nBut if it's a question of who can come in with the lowest CPM, you can't compete with a direct booking and $1.78 CPM is the lowest CPM I've seen in a while",

To smooth out those swings, some  devs or publishers whatever turn to ad mediation because it combines multiple networks and optimizes fill rates, which helps stabilize revenue and makes it more consistent overall.\n\nAs for forecasting, they generally work pretty well in standard conditions, and that link shared in the discussion on historical CPM trends is definitely useful. But it’s worth keeping in mind that forecasting accuracy heavily depends on the quality of your input data e.g. traffic volume, audience behavior, and seasonality. Even when trends are well-known (like January dips), their accuracy relies a lot on the stability of your user base. External factors like privacy policy changes (IDFA, for example) or unexpected market shifts can throw those predictions off. To manage these risks, I’d recommend not just relying on historical data but also running regular audits of your inventory and experimenting with new ad formats. For instance, trying out hybrid models (rewarded + native ads) or A/B testing different waterfalls can sometimes uncover unexpected opportunities for growth.",

Recently, I completed The TradeDesks Kokai UI training and the videos were more high level, explanations of the AI co-pilot, not a lot of hands on training in the platform, or specifics in regards to optimizations to look for daily. I suppose I am looking for quick tips and tricks, that sort of thing. Has anyone stumbled onto better training videos somewhere? I feel like I am just floating my accounts and going through the motions... I want to know how to increase their success and GROW my clients business. Any advice would be lovely! Thank you in advance!",

In order to become good at this you might have to expand your skillset a bit, depending on how much knowledge you have already in these areas. First I would recommend getting really good at exporting data from the platform in various reports, including formats such as CSV. Then how to import this data into various softwares for further analysis, from basic tools such as Excel to more advanced tools. To give you a hands-on example of what I mean. Let's say you work for a customer who sells their product offline or who measures some kind of offline datapoint (so not just online conversions). Let's say you can ask your customer to provide you with daily or weekly measurements of the goal they have (such as offline sales, retail store visits or similar). This data could be put side-by-side with daily ad impression data from your campaigns and then you can run regression analysis to see if there is correlation between your ads and their offline sales or store visits. Looking also into things like for example delays (ad impression in day 1, made a purchase in day 2 etc). Downloaded raw data on conversions or online sales can be used to build prediction models and so forth. So beyond learning the platform and its settings using videos, tutorials etc I would recommend really getting into the data and analytics bit of programmatic as there is a lot of data in there that can be used to improve advertising.",

          "body": "That's great. Most of the new frontend AI tools have impressive capability to work with different data formats. If you want to for example analyse variable importance (feature importance) in impression and conversion data from your DSP you can use the ML tools in cloud platforms such as Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure. There you can upload data in CSV format. Those services will do a lot of the hard work for you and it's fairly easy to get valuable insights there on what are the key drivers behind conversions or sales for example. You will most likely need to prepare the data a bit before uploading. There's usually quite a lot of asymmetry in the data downloads where you probably have tons of impressions with no conversions and a few with conversions, making it easy for an ML model to predict most impressions won't generate conversions (and be right most of the time..). So making the data set a bit more challenging for the machine learning model to handle will likely make it more useful. The new ML cloud services make using this type of analysis easier than before.\n\nBeyond DSP data downloads I usually look into data from Google Analytics in a similar way but use their API to download data from there into ML models. If your customers really want to get great results they should provide you with what you need such as GA data access. As an example if GA data can tell you that cities with a few thousand inhabitants convert better than larger cities then that could be useful in your DSP targeting later on.",
