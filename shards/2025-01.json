Not sure if this falls directly into programmatic, but our agency has our programmatic department cover all media outside of search and social, including host read podcast ads.\n\nI am looking for your experience or recommendations for measurement vendors/platforms that allow our brand to measure cross device effectiveness across multiple ad networks for host read ads (DAI). I understand that most vendors ID graph solution is modeled or deterministic given the limitations of host read tracking but want to hear what’s worked for your brands\n\nWhen we have worked with SXM in the past they let us measure via Claritas and I liked the data but the UI and reporting was a bit lackluster. We want to broaden our list of preferred partners/vendors to help our brands get the best value depending on how diverse their HR activations are. \n\nFor more context our agency mainly leverages CM360 for aggregated ad server measurement across DSPs and direct activations, but they currently do not have solutions catered for host read. Some of our brands also use MMM tools but those vary (Measured, NorthBeam, etc)\n\nUltimately just want to have additional data that is agnostic from the owned and operated ad networks to verify if their shows are performing well without bias. \n\nThank you, and happy new year!

Do meetings with tech vendors and people from other companies in the industry. Visit trade shows (like Dmexco), network and meet (online or in person) people from different adtech companies. You'd be surprised how much knowledge you can get from a 1h meeting with an experienced 'sales' person from an adtech company if you ask a lot of questions. Many of the business execs or account managers have a lot of product knowledge about their specific areas. View or attend IAB webinars or seminars. Join IAB groups or task forces of different kinds (if you can), do the work, attend the meetings or calls, participate. You might end up in a room with some very skilled people if you are lucky that talks about stuff you can't read somewhere easily. \n\nThere's lots of technical documentation available as well to read or skim through. Say you for example would have had an interest in things like the privacy sandbox and data, there's tons of in depth information to read if you do some research. Like the the UK CMA reports (example https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6731ffb00d90eee304badaff/CMA\\_s\\_Q2\\_to\\_Q3\\_2024\\_report.pdf) or the various Github pages (like https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics or https://patcg.github.io/ppa-api/). Of course a lot of that and similar information is targeted to developers but can be worth to skim through for different topics. Or if you'd like to learn about a topic like cookie syncing and how Google handles it then their documentation has tons of info, like here: https://developers.google.com/authorized-buyers/rtb/cookie-guide",

The platform decides how much of that future revenue they’re willing to buy upfront at that price. Publisher gets the cash day 1.\n\nObv there are trade-offs based on how volatile the ad revenues are wrt predicted revenues values and the pricing should be done based on that. The platform isn’t letting publishers offload everything. They’d probably keep 20-25% of the inventory in play so the publisher stays motivated to keep ad revenue strong. But beyond that, no clawbacks if revenue drops and no upside if it spikes.\n\nAlso heres the kicker – if the publisher feels confident that ad revenue could outperform they could buy additional percentages from the secondary market. This gives them a chance to double down if they see potential for stronger returns.\n\nThink of it like a prepaid forward – publisher sells a chunk of future inventory at a set price, gets paid now, and just rides out the contract. Curious if that sounds workable or if there’s something obvious I’m missing.",

You can make a chart and compare your CPM for the same inventory across multiple DSPs as well to see sometimes big differences.

In the win reports this will be clear as big fat horizontal lines in the chart at integer and popular levels where a lot of the wins take place near those numbers. \n\nSo as an example maybe a lot of people bid at 5 USD CPM max in their DSP but not as many at 5.05 USD CPM, then at 6 comes a new bunch. Etc. Of course if they use an algo and dynamic CPM the case would be different but when a campaign manager enters their max CPM during setup many of them enter some integer and some of them more common than others.

However, the DSP we’re currently using **piles all campaigns together**, making it extremely difficult to manage them effectively.\n\nWe need a solution that can:\n\n\t•\tSeparate and organize campaigns by client and project.\n\n\t•\tAllow teams to work independently on specific client campaigns without interference.\n\n\t•\tProvide clear and intuitive reporting at both the client and project levels.\n\nWe’ve looked into tools like **The Trade Desk**, but unfortunately, their pricing and minimums are way out of reach for us right now.\n\nAre there any DSPs you’d recommend that fit these requirements and are more accessible for smaller agencies like ours?\n\nThanks in advance for your help! 🙏",

But comparing it to other bigger agencies so far I’ll say this:\n\nPros\n- Less internal politics because your manager will be in the US. So people seem more friendly and collaborative (to me)\n- It seems they’re getting accounts from Omnicom media after the merger so it seems they’re expanding here\n- ⁠Pay is substantially more than non retail agencies and my immediate managers seem friendly and supportive so far.\n\nCons:\n1) A bit more disorganized compared to what you’ll see in other big agencies (IPG, Publicist or GroupM). Some processes are flywheel and the others are Omnicom so it can be a bit confusing on things.\n\n2) I personally think upward mobility here is really limited because there is one senior manager under whom there are 10-15 managers. So it might be difficult to move up the corporate ladder here. I also heard this from an ex employee here.⁠\n\n3) You will be limited to just certain DSPs. For example I’m on Walmart team so I only have run campaigns on Walmart and TradeDesk. If you’re on the Amazon team you’ll only be running programmatic campaigns on Amazon.

While I’ve had success getting responses from senior level folks at DSPs, reaching out to publishers has been a whole different game.  \n  \nI get that publishers have their hands full and might be receiving a ton of emails from ad networks, all promising how they’ll effectively monetize if they use their network. I totally get why they'd be skeptical or just overwhelmed—it’s probably tough to figure out who’s worth replying to and who’s not.  \n  \nHeres where I’m stuck: I’m trying to kick off conversations about ad-tech solutions and potential partnerships, but I’m not sure if I’m targeting the wrong people or if my approach just sucks.\n\nwhat’s the best way to reach these folks? Is it email? linkedIn? twitter? reddit? who’s the right person to talk to? should I be looking at someone specific, like a revenue ops person, ad ops, or someone else entirely?\n\nI’ve tried cold outreach, and honestly, it’s been pretty meh. maybe my messaging needs work, or maybe publishers just don’t care unless you’re already in their inner circle.\n\nif you’ve cracked this code or have any tips, I’m all ears. how do you actually get a foot in the door without coming across as just another spammy message in their inbox?\n\nAppreciate any advice.

I said this in another post but everything is very account specific, not even agency specific. I had one agency job before moving to an in-house programmatic team and got unbelievably lucky - I was on the most established, biggest account at my agency (which is one of the most well known ones among the ‘big four’). Someone else noted in another post that you should also ask how long the agency has had the account - a new account is likely going to be very stressful.\n\nThe pay is also an obvious con but I think that’s not unique to any one agency role, just being agency side specifically.",

You'll get exposure to more of the business in a big agency, so as long as you network you'll gain a ton of knowledge and experience.\n\nCons: depending on the engagement, the client is often paying a 60 or even 75% markup for your service. For example, an analytics manager can earn $150-175k because the client is paying $600k as a part of a larger contract.  Larger companies have been building their own internal agencies for this reason. They can give you a pay raise, you'd only have one client, and they're saving a ton of money.\n\nWhy is that a con? The agency model is starting to decline. When big clients leave, jobs quickly disappear, moreso than ever.  It's part of the impetus for the IPG+Omnicom merger.",

No audience provider is omniscient and there's going to be error (especially in anything \"off the shelf\").\n\nIf you already have \\~50% chance of reaching a dog owner via not targeting at all, there's a good chance that the price of the data will cancel out the benefit of focusing the campaign.\n\nThat being said, location and transaction vendors would be worth considering.\n\nIn my experience CPMs are usually quite low for location vendors, but methodologically, I think InMarket/NinthDecimal is really strong.\n\nStay away from Mastercard or anything that's aggregated at the ZIP code level, it's too expensive for the signal:noise ratio you're going to get.\n\nYou might also have some luck working with survey-based psychographic vendors, like AnalyticsIQ, it's modeled up but if you have a niche audience you're struggling to find, there's a lot more flexibility in this approach that isn't dependent upon a big box giving up its customer data.\n\nGood luck!",

Consider if there is a higher concentration than average of potential customers in certain geographic areas. Surely not everyone living there is a potential customer but if a sufficiently large enough percentage of them are then it could be worth targeting that area and accept the waste. CPM’s for this type of targeting can also be lower than what you get with pin-point targeting.\n\nStart with an idea of how many percent in general of the entire population are potential customers. Say it is 5% just as an example. Then let’s say you can find an area where that percentage is 20%. A lot higher than average. Then scale that into many areas. Maybe narrow it down with some more demographis etc. In your mind, think of a map of the region with some areas marked in red and some areas marked in green. The green ones you want to target. Look for data sources (like public stats databases) with this information (% of households with a pet by location, for example). \n\nThis is not at all intended to be a perfect targeting strategy with 100% accuracy but it will give you a bigger toolbox beyond just perfect data and one an experienced advertiser who understands the limits of only going after pin-point data will maybe buy into.",

From my vantage point, I'm having trouble justifying why I (or anyone) would buy online video on the open web for a few reasons:\n\n1. Quality: it seems like the vast majority of inventory is low quality - small player size, outstream (not inherently bad but arguably worse than instream), sound off, and/or delivered on sites with tons of ads\n   * Is there any way to understand or control delivery based on the number of ads on a page within a DSP or other tools? If so, what are they?\n2. User Expectation/Experience: maybe its just me but i can't remember the last time I watched a video on a publisher site; if i'm on web it's to read. I go elsewhere for video. I could see sports maybe being the exception to this, but tell me if my perception is off here.\n\nUltimately there are just so many other places I would spend video dollars first (YouTube, CTV, etc) that I am wondering how you make the case for open web. Or are you strictly tapping into specific suppliers or PMP/PG for quality video?\n\nA separate but related note is that I feel like my agency's programmatic team sucks. They default every buy to open web and do nothing to improve quality or curate differentiated supply. They resist anything that would a) make more work for them or b) cause an increase in CPMs - even with clients directly asking for instream only OLV and being comfortable with double the cost; but I digress.",

Are there other techniques you use that might help, especially in cases where the list of sites I need to deliver on is limited?

So an agency’s trading desk include specialists who work within these DSPs (DV360, TTD, etc) to win desirable inventory based on a series of levers (base/max bid price, time of day, publisher, etc). \n\nAgency direct media buying refers to an agency negotiating and securing “premium” inventory from a publisher that belongs to them, and them alone (i.e cannot be bought programmatically). This is a bit of a grey area, because some publishers will guarantee a percentage of their inventory to a buyer while putting the rest up for auction Programmatically, but that’s the general gist. \n\nTo put it in simpler terms: imagine a premium publisher like Hulu. They have a ton of ad inventory, especially against their premium shows (let’s say The Bear, as an example). If they put that inventory up for auction, it’ll drive significantly high CPMs in a programmatic auction because lots of advertisers want that space. But let’s say Hulu has a great relationship with Horizon Media - and horizon asks if they can secure 20% of ad inventory against that show. Hulu will grant Horizon that inventory at a high CPM, which horizon can then pitch to clients as an offering (where they will increase the CPM on their end to secure margin).\n\nThe benefit for Hulu, aside from a good partnership, is they are guaranteed to sell a % of their inventory which makes forecasting revenue significantly easier. The benefit for Horizon, obviously, is the inventory they can now pitch to clients (whereas other agencies may struggle to win the inventory programmatically depending on how competitive the space is).\n\nOne last wrinkle, not to totally confuse you: Agency direct deals can still be executed in a programmatic DSP via Programmatic Guarantee deals - which are the same as direct buy deals, just streamlined within a DSP for ease of activation (rather than going directly to Hulu for trafficking, all the pipes are connected directly within the DSP. Which also makes it easier for reporting purposes). \n\nHope this helps.",

Is there any incentive for agencies to push media buying clients into their trading desk vs. direct media purchase (e.g., maybe it is higher margin for the agency?)? Within Agency direct media buying, do the agencies ever work with third-parties? Or are agencies incentivized not to because that would entail giving up a piece of their margin?",

          "body": "I think the best way to visualize and understand this is by understanding what programmatic buying solves. \n\nTaking a step back, there’s a concept of “walled gardens,” which in simple terms means media/data providers that refuse to share/link their data to the rest of the media ecosystem. Meaning, every advertiser is trying to understand what piece of media truly made an impact to their bottom line. But because Google, meta (aka walled gardens) don’t allow for a universal identifier which marketers can use to see the true path to conversion, there’s a bunch of fragmentation in reporting. Meaning, without this universal identifier, we’ll always have a muddy picture as to what channel should truly get credit for a conversion - if a user is reached by meta, Google, email, and programmatic - then all 4 would take credit for the conversion and you have inflated conversion totals where the count of conversions is greater than the count of sales (for example) - whereas you may only want to give credit to the final touch point in a user’s path. It’s a frustrating problem - and whoever finds the magic formula to build a reliable MMM model will become a billionaire overnight. \n\nBut programmatic solves this, to a degree, because it’s a centralized platform where all media buying occurs. You can purchase display, video, CTV, audio, DOOH, etc - and see what % of your users were reached by each channel before converting. It relies on a universal identifier - which enhances data cleanliness and arms marketers with the ability to make data driven decisions. \n\nBut alas, we’ll never reach a world where media is 100% programmatic because $$ goes to where  eyeballs are. Google is always gonna have a strangle hold on search and YouTube. And meta is the dominant social platform with TikTok (another walled garden) waiting in the wings. \n\nNow to answer your q about why agencies have trading arms: direct buys mean you’re at the mercy of the publisher. Think of it as a black box. You send them tags, and through that measure impressions, clicks, conversions, etc…but they control the levers. They choose when the ad is served, who to, what content, etc. That poses some risk to the marketer, who has to rely on the publisher’s ability to execute the buy. In addition, it requires a lot of middle men. \n\nWhereas programmatically, you’re in the driver seat as a trader. You setup and manage the campaign, get daily reporting, make routine optimizations, shift budgets around, etc. \n\nAs for third parties: agencies work with a ton of third parties for measurement and data solutions. They’ll sometimes, if bandwidth is strained, outsource trafficking and campaign execution to sister agencies if needed, too. But yes, to your point, it all affects the bottom line - so agencies will weigh the pros and cons of any decision that goes into the strategy, and only greenlight stuff that will be profitable or is necessary to preserve the partnership. \n\nThe incentive for agencies to push media buying to their trading desk (aside from ease of activation) is also margin. Remember, programmatic is an auction. Some agencies will promise a CPM of (example) $5 to their clients, while knowing they can buy the media for $2 (cheap inventory where the client may be overlooking the quality of said inventory). They’ll bake in fees they pay for data providers, the DSP, etc and turn a nice profit (just an example, not all do this). But if they can’t fulfill at $2, maybe they raise their bid to $3 or whatever. They don’t get that luxury with direct buys, as those are often fixed- price. \n\nThink I covered everything but let me know if I missed something. Cheers",

But you are expecting a ready made prod ready, then it isn't. You'll need to invest in engineering time to make it prod ready. \n\n**The open source code includes the following:**\n\n* Core RTB System - core handles bid requests, filtering, routing, and integrating third party data.\n* Bidder Components & Plugins:\n   * Exchange Connectors: Adapters that convert bid requests from exchanges to OpenRTB format(Google AdX, AppNexus, Rubicon, BidSwitch etc.).\n   * Bidding Agents: comes with a default fixed price agent. custom agents can be implemented in C++ or JavaScript(you have to do it on your own).\n   * Augmentor: supports external data integrations (e.g., Redis is built-in)\n   * Post Auction Service: handles win, click, and conversion matching.\n* Logging & Monitoring: Graphite/Carbon for real-time analytics.\n\n  \n**What is not part of the open source:**\n\n* Bid Optimization Engine- they provided a hosted optimizer then that integrates with RTBKit but optimization logic (e.g., ML models for bidding strategy) is not included.\n* Campaign Management UI: while RTBKit provides APIs, they does not offer an open source UI for campaign management. there might be third-party tools, but you must integrate them manually.\n* Advanced Frequency Capping & Recency Control: They provided an example implementation of freq capping using augmentors. however full fledged freq control logic is not built in and needs to be implemented by you.\n* Pacing & Budget Allocation: banking system is open source but custom pacing algorithms need to be implemented by you.\n\n# Comment on its Perf. & Scalability\n\nRTBKit is fairly good but not the absolute *best* in terms of raw performance. It can handle around **10K QPS per instance**(can be increased to 100K QPS with horizontal scaling), which could be decent for many mid size bidders. however it’s not optimized for ultra low latency ops at a large scale(TTD receives \\~15 mil bid request per sec, most of them are though duplicated impressions)- expect some big engineering overhead if you need high freq bidding with sub-10ms response times. even though their architecture is horizontally scalable, a lot of performance tuning (optimizing augmentors, reducing unnecessary logging for e.g.) still needs to done to handle real world traffic.",
