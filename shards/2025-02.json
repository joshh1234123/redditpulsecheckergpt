This: \n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a418880](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a418880)\n\n3) Said company made an audience defined as \"users that did X or why on my site\"\n\n4) You did \"x or y\" in their site, the L.I. pixel looks at all records from the Vendor website collected through their pixel that matches the definition and creates a group of actionable IDs matching said definition\n\n5) The Vendor buys the following service from LinkedIn - and activates InMail from the audience definition above:\n\n[https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/message-ads](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/message-ads)\n\n6) Voila!

You also get access to YT Programmatic Guaranteed deals, Instant Reserve and YouTube TV (YT TV is currently only in the US). YT falls under non-exchange and the tech fee is much lower compared to the open exchange fee. Since you have a 7 figure ad spend, I think you can leverage it to secure favourable rates. I think the fee is worth it and you get full transparency on actual ad spend and partner fees.

My goal is to make **enterprise grade open programmatic tools more accessible** – so you can implement header bidding effectively without breaking the bank on an ad network or saleshouse.\n\nThis **unified, easy-to-use platform** lets you manage the entire header bidding stack, deploy changes on demand without any developer resources, conduct a/b tests, and review ad performance in real-time (even log level reporting). All in a **streamlined solution that is free-to-use**!\n\nWould you find this platform useful? I’d love to hear your feedback! What’s the best way to get pros like you to try it out? If you’ve used similar platforms before, what made you stay (or switch)? Also, if you're interested in **early access**, drop a comment or DM me – would love to chat. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! \n\n🚀Available second half of February",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been working in **digital and programmatic advertising for the past 10 years**, and throughout my experience, I’ve seen how time-consuming campaign execution can be. Whether it’s **setting up IOs, trafficking creatives, or troubleshooting**, traders spend hours on repetitive tasks, and **agencies often overextend resources hiring full-time staff for work that fluctuates month-to-month.**\n\nFreelance platforms like UpWork can be helpful for one-off tasks, but they often lack **commitment, reliability, or deep programmatic expertise**. That’s why I decided to build **Programmatic Pilot** – a flexible, **on-demand service where agencies can get expert programmatic execution without long-term hires.**\n\nThe idea is simple: agencies **only pay for what they need**, whether it’s **campaign setups, optimizations, reporting, or troubleshooting.** Instead of hiring full-time or relying on inconsistent freelancers, [https://programmaticpilot.com](https://programmaticpilot.com) takes care of execution efficiently and on demand.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts on this approach—do you think this is something agencies would find valuable? Any feedback or suggestions are appreciated!\n\nThanks!",

My initial thought is that I would always prefer to directly hire a contractor because there’s control over communication and skill level. Oftentimes contractors are getting access to agency internal platforms, documents, chats, etc etc.  so there’s a certain level of trust (or NDAs) involved. \n\nMy other thought is that many contractors are hooked up with their gigs in a similar fashion as this service you’re offering— except in a more informal way. The fixer maintains a small network of vetted contractors and connects them to agencies they are in contact with when help is needed. From there it’s hands off and up to the contractor. \n\nNot ragging on your startup whatsoever, just giving my stream of thoughts.",

The idea is to offer agencies consistency & expertise without them needing to go through the process of hiring, onboarding, and vetting contractors individually.\n\nYou’re 100% right that direct contractor relationships work well for some agencies, especially when trust is established. The challenge I’ve seen is that some agencies struggle to find reliable, experienced contractors when they need them, or they over-hire full-time staff for tasks that fluctuate in workload.\n\nProgrammatic Pilot is meant to fill that gap—a structured, scalable way for agencies to get expert campaign execution when needed, without long-term hiring.\n\nAgain, thanks for the feedback!",

It's also incredibly manual, where every feature has an associated cost. You can do just about anything on TTD, but you'd be better served by already having DSP knowledge before you spin up a campaign there. TTD is incredibly neutral in terms of attribution credit. Google tends to put its thumb on lots of scales considering how much of the programmatic landscape they own.\n\nTTD also goes through more major changes than DV360, in my experience. I've had to learn and relearn how to use TTD three times since I started using it in 2021. From legacy to Solimar to Kokai.",

I understand AI and algorithms take time to adjust, but most of the time, I end up pausing the campaign.\n\n**Here are my observations and questions:**\n\n1. If I set a daily budget of $100 and get a sale, I often raise the budget by $50, hoping the ad that converted will continue performing. But instead, the campaign breaks. Would it be better to wait until the campaign consistently spends its budget and generates daily conversions before increasing it?\n2. Sometimes, my campaign doesn’t fully spend its daily budget (e.g., $70 out of $100) but still converts. Is it logical to increase the budget if it’s not even fully utilizing the current one? Would raising CPC be a better approach?\n3. I’ve noticed that when a product performs well (getting multiple daily sales from one strong ad and consistently spending its budget), increasing the budget by $50-$100 doesn’t break the campaign—instead, it improves performance.\n\nI’m feeling a bit lost, especially with small products that are harder to scale in general. Are there any courses, books, or seminars you’d recommend to better understand budget optimization in DSPs and CPC? I would love to hear your advice and experience on this.\n\nThanks a lot!",

Try and have at least a few consistent sales over the course of 1-2 week(s) before making those types of changes.

I started alongside another colleague, and we work well together. Initially, our team was led by a Head of Programmatic. Now, we report to a supervisor who helps us when needed, though they she is not highly specialized in programmatic. If something complex comes up, we can still reach out to our former Head of Programmatic, who now acts as a consultant. Overall, I’m quite independent and learning a lot.\n\nRecently, though, I received a message on LinkedIn with an offer from Heart & Science for a similar role. Since I’m still early in my career, I don’t want to come across as ungrateful or act in a way that seems unprofessional, especially since this company trained me and gave me an opportunity. At the same time, I want to consider what’s best for my future.\n\nWhat would you advise? Is it fair to explore this opportunity, or would it be wrong given that my current company invested in me? And if I decide to listen to the offer, how can I do so professionally while respecting my current employer?\n\nThanks a lot for any advice!",

However, this discrepancy seems more pronounced when analyzing DV360 data.\n\n# Example:\n\n* Meta (December Data)\n   * 13,947 link clicks\n   * 12,498 GA4 sessions\n   * Not a perfect match, but fairly close.\n* DV360 Lead Gen Campaign\n   * 8,607 reported clicks\n   * 143 reported conversions (tracked through click-to-call and a soft lead button event on the landing page)\n   * GA4 Data:\n      * 67 sessions reported\n      * 0 soft leads or calls attributed to the source/medium\n\nUpon further investigation, I noticed that some landing page query strings containing utm\\_source=youtube were attributed to Google CPC instead of YouTube/DV360.\n\n# The Question\n\nWhy is our YouTube/DV360 data not appearing correctly in GA4? This issue seems unique to DV360/YouTube, as our other channels track properly. Despite DV360 reporting conversions, we can’t connect them properly in GA4—possibly due to tracking loss or being overwritten by Google CPC attribution.\n\n# Additional Context\n\n* Our GA4 attribution model is set to Data-Driven, but we are open to testing other models if that could resolve the issue.\n* This discrepancy also occurs with other third-party vendors running display/OTT (streaming) ads to a landing page. While streaming traffic behaves differently, I wanted to mention it in case it’s relevant.\n\nHas anyone encountered a similar issue? Any insights would be greatly appreciated!",

          "body": "DV360 and YouTube attribution issues in GA4 are a common frustration, so you're definitely not alone.\n\nIt's especially confusing when other channels like Meta seem to work fine.\n\nThe problem you're seeing, where DV360 traffic is misattributed to Google CPC or showing large discrepancies, is a known issue that can stem from a few different factors, often related to how Google's different platforms talk to each other.\n\nThe core of the problem often lies in the interaction between DV360's tracking and GA4's default auto-tagging.\n\nWhile the GA4 property is linked to your DV360 advertiser, a DV360 auto-tagging parameter called `dclid` is added to your URLs.\n\nThis is meant to help GA4 attribute traffic correctly, but sometimes it can conflict with your UTM parameters or GA4's own logic, causing the traffic to be incorrectly categorized as `google / cpc`.\n\nThis can be compounded by differences in how each platform counts sessions and clicks.\n\nFor example, DV360 counts a \"click\" when a user interacts with an ad, but GA4 only counts a \"session\" when the landing page loads successfully.\n\nAdd in factors like ad blockers, quick-bouncing users, and network latency, and that discrepancy can become massive.\n\nA key part of troubleshooting this is making sure your account linking and attribution settings are configured correctly.\n\nFirst, ensure your GA4 property is properly linked to your DV360 advertiser, and that auto-tagging is enabled in the link settings.\n\nThis link is the most reliable way to pass campaign data between the two platforms.\n\nSecond, review your GA4 attribution settings.\n\nWhile Data-Driven Attribution is a powerful model, it requires a significant amount of data to work effectively.\n\nIf your conversion volume is low, it might be defaulting to a different model or struggling to accurately credit the right touchpoints.\n\nYou might consider temporarily testing a different attribution model, like `Google paid channels last click`, to see if it helps clarify the reporting.\n\nThird, check your manual UTM tags.\n\nEven with auto-tagging, it's possible for manual tags to conflict or be incomplete.\n\nFor YouTube, you should be linking your YouTube channel to DV360 as well, as this helps with video-specific metrics.\n\nFinally, because this issue is often platform-wide, be prepared for some level of discrepancy.\n\nProgrammatic display and OTT campaigns will almost never have a perfect 1:1 match with sessions and conversions in GA4.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the gap and ensure the data is directionally accurate.\n\nIf you've done all of the above, it might be a good idea to create a custom report in the GA4 Explore section, as it allows you to use dimensions like `Session manual source / medium` which can sometimes show the correct UTM values even when the default traffic reports don't.",

I was really excited to start seeing conversion data last year, but it slowed in the 4th quarter and we're only seeing maybe 20% of the conversion data so far this quarter as we've seen in previous quarters.  \n  \nThere haven't been a lot of substantial changes to account settings. We do bid on quite a bit of public inventory, and that has changed up a bit, but we're using the same audiences. I figure this is something on Google's end- like they lost some data partnerships or are transitioning to a different tracking method. I was hoping someone else might have more info here.",

The main argument was that if you truly aspire to achieve something significant, there’s no alternative to working hard and making sacrifices. The idea of “doing just enough” is often just an excuse for a lack of discipline or drive.\n\nI work in the programmatic industry, but right now, I don’t have many active campaigns. My company is focusing on acquiring new clients through RFPs, and in the meantime, I try to stay informed and take courses like TTD’s. But reading that post made me worry that I’m not doing enough to grow.\n\nDo you think success in programmatic truly requires an extreme, all-in approach? Or is it possible to grow while maintaining a more balanced lifestyle?\n\nHave you seen examples of people achieving meaningful success without burning out?",

Most people do just enough because there’s no massive reward at the end.\n\nThe definition of \"extreme\" is subjective, and in my view, programmatic advertising isn't a high-value skill with limitless earning potential. Think of it like this: if someone dedicates their life to becoming the best chess grandmaster and another person does the same for winning a tennis Grand Slam, who will make more money? No matter how hard you work, every industry has a ceiling on success and income. Programmatic advertising has a ceiling too you can't break it with sheer effort alone.\n\nThat's why it makes more sense to give about 80% effort. Beyond that, the marginal return on extra sacrifice and hard work is low. If you really want to make a killing in this industry, grinding like a donkey won’t cut it you need to work smart. Automate, build efficient workflows, and leverage tech.\n\nYes, hard work is necessary, but it has to come with the right kind of reward. Imagine if winning a tennis Grand Slam didn’t pay well and had no sponsors would we still see top-tier players? Probably not. Rewards drive people. For younger individuals, it's all about big wins.

Long hours are required sometimes, but if you're pulling more than 1-2 late nights a year, you have to wonder if the problems are due to capacity/staffing. You don't need to know how to build a media plan like you're on the strategy team, but you do need to know how to fill in the gaps/maximize the impact of the campaign with programmatic tactics. Because programmatic can help with a lot of different types of campaigns and run across many channels, this skill is very important.

That way you can see exactly what they're buying and how, and then learn from it before building your own campaigns. \n\nAvoid MNTN at all costs in case they come for you to try and win your business though.\n\nNote: Not a salesperson for any DSP or adtech company.",

The biggest issue with jumping in without a lot of experience is managing the right kind of inventory for what you want to do. You can get a self-serve DSP/platform and have a commercial running in a few hours. But the inventory itself is so varied.\n\nDepending on budget, you can also do 2-3 different types of buys. Programmatic is the \"easiest\" - click a few buttons and bam CTV ads. But you can also get stuck with bad inventory or going for too cheap of inventory to really be worth it. Or you go for premium inventory but its not really worth it for your goals or geo.     \n\nI would recommend using an Agency OR a managed buy with a DSP to start. Feel free to hit me up if you want some legit options and advice. I've worked on CTV campaigns for 6 years now and have learned a ton.

These variations seem quite \"random,\" as they are large fluctuations—one day, the campaign has an 80% ROI, and the next day, the same campaign is at -40%. This did not happen before **December 20**.\n   * This makes ROI predictability difficult, as depending on the cost of traffic on a given day, the profit can be higher or lower.\n   * Some campaigns that were highly profitable have seen much lower margins due to these fluctuations.\n2. **Drop in Google Ad Manager (GAM) eCPM**\n   * eCPM (effective cost per thousand impressions) is one of the key factors that determine our ad revenue.\n   * Recently, we have noticed a sharp drop in eCPM, meaning we are earning less money for every thousand impressions served.\n3. **Increase in unfilled ad impressions (lower fill rate)**\n   * The fill rate represents the percentage of ad requests that successfully serve an ad.\n   * When this rate drops, it means more impressions go unfilled, directly reducing monetization.\n\n**Market Conversations**  \nBeyond our own analysis, we have been speaking with **other market players**, and they are all reporting the **same difficulties**. The situation appears to be widespread, with **several publishers facing similar challenges**. Additionally, **ADXs themselves have also reported difficulties** in their operations, indicating that the drop in performance is not an isolated case but rather a broader shift in the ecosystem.",

Some of my comments may not be relevant or already explored, so feel free to point out anything that has already been investigated.\n\nFor both Meta and GAM, I see a few “grey hat” techniques that might be worth considering, but it’s probably too early since we haven’t established a clear diagnosis yet.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some key assumptions and additional questions:\n\n**Assumptions & Questions**\n\n**Assumption 1**\n\nYour arbitrage setup yields an average margin of less than 10% per impression, meaning that any fluctuation directly impacts profitability.\n\n**Assumption 2**\n\nYou're using a two-click setup, where traffic is first redirected to an intermediary page before landing on the final page where GAM monetizes.\n\n**Questions**\n\n* Are you primarily driving traffic on mobile or desktop? (Just checking if recent iOS updates could be a contributing factor.)\n* Regarding the Meta CPC and GAM eCPM anomalies, how granular was your analysis? Do these discrepancies appear across all reporting dimensions—even when cross-analyzing two, three, or more layers? Or are there specific segments where inefficiencies are more pronounced?\n\n**Comments on the GAM Side**\n\n* This might seem obvious, but seasonality impacts GAM eCPMs, which are generally lower in January and February.\n* More broadly, many publishers and media owners have reported a particularly slow start this year compared to 2024.\n* On a more specific note, GAM has been known to adjust monetization rules based on traffic quality and landing page performance. These changes are difficult to detect, and in many cases, we only find out months later—sometimes only through insider info.\n\n**Comments on the Meta Side**\n\n* I’ve seen similar fluctuations before—always-on campaigns can experience temporary anomalies, but they tend to stabilize over time.\n* Recently, Meta has dealt with aggressive “borderline” advertisers spending massive amounts at very low CPMs. Most of them have been banned, but some have repeatedly tried to re-enter the network. Knowing their time was limited, they took an extremely aggressive approach, which may have temporarily inflated CPM competition. While the peak occurred in December, some remnants of this behavior still persist.\n* Another possibility—sometimes an arbitrage niche simply gets discovered by other arbitragers, increasing competition. I’ve seen this happen repeatedly.\n\n**Other Key Factors**\n\n* Arbitrage setups always face discrepancies in reported user data across platforms. Meta might report X, Google Analytics Y, and so on. Have you noticed any shifts in these discrepancies that could offer additional clues?",

If the issue is specific to GAM, that would be a valuable insight.\n* Have you tried securing a DSP seat (e.g., DV360) to buy your own inventory? This would allow you to analyze how it appears in a DSP and check if any quality indicators (e.g., Active View) are being downgraded.\n* Any specific setup details in GAM we should be aware of? Have you at least temporarily raised floors to prevent monetizing at unprofitable CPMs?\n\n**Potential Actions – Meta**\n\n* Like GAM, Meta frequently adjusts its auction model, especially during high-activity periods. These updates are rarely disclosed in real-time, and we usually learn about them months later through insider sources.\n* Meta also increases costs when campaigns repeatedly hit the same audience segments to mitigate ad fatigue and prevent poor user experience.\n* Meta has an internal ad quality rating—some ad creatives and their associated metrics can eventually be flagged as underperforming. When this happens, auctions become biased against them, leading to increased CPMs.\n* Have you tried recreating the campaign? Since Meta’s optimization algorithms converge over time and may not adapt dynamically to changing conditions, a fresh campaign with new data could improve results.\n* It seems like your setup gives Meta’s optimization engine a lot of freedom. Have you enforced strict thresholds for CPA, ROAS, bid CPM, or any other key metric? Setting tighter constraints might reduce traffic volume but would help maintain profitability.\n\n ",

With all that being said, is there anything else we should be focusing on?  What's most important to CTV programmatic buyers these days that I might be missing?",

We’re talking about the entire open internet, save the walled gardens of social platform and search engines. The internet is a massive space, with increasingly more bad content being monetized and, as noted by almost every comment on this thread, plagued by fraud. Navigating this can, and will be, hard and at times exhausting. You solve for one bad player, 5 more show up next week. The cycle doesn’t stop.\n\nThese problems become even more exasperated when you are not at a holding company sized agency with resources and teams dedicated to doing a lot of the inventory management and negotiation, allowing you to just focus on buying and optimizing.\n\nI started at a hold co and learned a TON. I am not at a smaller mid-market agency where we do not have a team dedicated to all the different facets of programmatic (data/targeting, identity resolution, analytics/tracking, inventory curation, etc.). When it is just you, or a small team, there are not enough hours in the day to do all of this in a meaningful way for a larger book of clients. Often times, it becomes a matter of getting things in market, optimizing to the best you can, and making sure you don’t set and forget and wind up with a display campaign that ran for 6 months and drove a 3.5% CTR. \n\nAll of that to say, I love programmatic. The technology is fascinating to me, I find it a lot more interesting than other paid channels that operate in a walled garden and there’s no “competitive edge” to any platform/vendor/tool.\n\nIf you go the holding company way, absorb as much as you can. Meet people who are not hands on keyboard and talk to them about what they do day to day (think roles that would typically fall in some iteration of a center of excellence).\n\nIf you go the small-mid agency route, be ready to get pulled in a lot of different directions. I am more involved than ever in the actual “business” side of the agency, more involved in creative conversation, more involved in analytics and tracking, etc. \n\nBoth are rewarding and both come with obvious pros and cons. At the end of the day we all put pictures on the internet. Do what you can, learn as much as possible, keep up (to the best of your ability) with the industry, and have some fun. When it stops being fun, identify what facet of programmatic you like the most and find somewhere that will let you do that for a living (often times this will be holdco or adtech) \n\nYou got this!",

          "body": "Let's just face it that there are some people managing programmatic for advertisers that don't put in the real effort needed to reduce bad quality traffic and inventory. Neither do some put in the effort needed to really work on the analytics and optimization side with the right tools to improve results. Poor quality / poor results of course leads to a reputation for programmatic with some advertisers as being a less attractive channel.\n\nUnfortunately, some people want the easy route so they just use maybe a single platform for all their buying, only use mostly the built in tools and use whatever optimization, brand safety and fraud prevention that is built in on auto-pilot. We all know this won't help in all scenarios.\n\nOn the other hand, thinking you can avoid any bot traffic or low quality traffic entirely is very naive. That won't be possible. You won't avoid bot traffic entirely if you go buy a large publisher directly either, it has nothing to do with programmatic. Which sites do you think AI bots for example prefer to scrape to get content into their machinery and do whatever they do with it (learn/train their AI, rewrite it for SEO spam farms and so forth)? Of course they love to visit high quality publishers and scrape their content. Do these bots load ads. Of course they do. It will happen even if you book a direct campaign with a top quality publisher. So don't be naive and think you can reduce low quality traffic to zero in your campaigns. The question is rather how can you with a lot of active work reduce it to a level you and the advertiser can accept, most likely because the positive results from the ad campaign will mitigate the waste from the bot/fraud/low quality traffic.\n\nDon't hesitate to get into programmatic but if you do, expect to do a lot of work if you want to be above the X% in performance who take the easy route and deliver medium/poor quality ad campaigns for their clients. Your campaigns will most likely not be great if you only rely on auto-pilot tools. So get your skills up in analytics, optimization and so forth. If you see a huge discrepancy between clicks and real site sessions then go in there and do something about it. But if you don't even know you have that problem, then you are probably part of the X%.",

I think we'll see lots of urgent deals like Getty-Shutterstock. \n\n*Maybe* some interesting stuff from NFLX, AMZN/WMT--?",

And yes I know it's crazy that after this long I don't know when I should be an expert already! \n\nThe issue is that in the first 1y5 of my career in Prog was just doing reporting because the AdOps people in my small agency would do the trafficking, set up campaigns and optimise, so as a campaign manager, I was just doing weekly reports and PCAs. \n\nI have now joined another agency where I'm supposed to do proper end-to-end campaign management but unfortunately I didn't spend much time working with DV360 and CM360 because my clients decided to solely do ABM campaigns and use managed service.\n\nThis is really frustrating because I'm a bit more senior but sometimes I feel I don't know the basics. I'm back managing campaigns on DV360, so I need to learn how to do optimisations and I have done lots of research but I I'm not finding good optimisations strategies specifically for Display, video or native ads on DV360 and when I find articles about optimisations, it's very generic.\n\nAll I wanted to know is specific steps I can take when KPIs/metrics such as impressions, clicks, spend, conversions, video views, CTR, CPC, CPM and VCR are either too low or too high.\n\nI managed to compile a bit of information on this. For example, I know I can look at changing the frequency cap, budget cap, pacing settings and viewability if the campaign is over pacing or under pacing. I did check of the Google Support articles for DV360 but they're not very specific. They only have articles on \"Optimized targeting\" and \"Optimize your YouTube campaign\". I also can't seem to find any YT videos teaching how to optimise programmatic campaigns. \n\nIt's so frustrating because my senior managers don't have time to train me and honestly I feel a bit embarrassed not knowing after a year in the company but they didn't even teach me when I first start. And trying to learn at home is challenging when resources are so scattered all over the Internet.\n\nSorry for the rant but does anyone has tips on how to optimise campaigns? I would really appreciate if someone could do a little breakdown. Thank you!\n\n",

Optimizations that would be more fluid in other platforms are a bit more manual in DV. It becomes a hunt to look for what’s messing with your campaign in the reporting, and inversely— look for good performance and then create a tactic just for that, whatever it may be.\n\nFor example— \n\nLook at inventory and exclude websites that are detrimental to your kpi. Let’s say you’re focusing on CPM— sort for the sites that have a sky high CPM with no engagement and exclude them. \n\nwhat geo is showing strong activity?

That meeting can happen after 1 year, 2 years or 5 years. \n\nFor optimization ask yourself questions then go figure out how to answer them, what data do you need, where can you find it:\n\n- What is the most important parameter in my targeting to influence conversions or other goals and what is its weighting versus other parameters? (dm me if you get stuck on this one and I’ll share how I calculate this)\n\n- What are the best performing geos/demographics/audiences? What are your ”red zones” (to avoid) and ”green zones” (to target). Similar to the ”no trade zones” for financial traders.\n\n- What is the quality of the traffic I’m getting?

          "body": "I approach optimisation as trying to guide your spend to the areas you want it to get to.\n\nDV360 pushes auto optimisation so KPI selection is important. Great if you can set up custom bidding. Then monitor the campaign to see if it's doing what you want / expect.\n\nFor example if optimizing to video completions, Google is going to be searching out low CPCV to drive views. Ideally your spend will concentrate on line items with best CPCV. If not you can make manual adjustments to push or throttle lines beyond what Google is naturally doing:\n- changing max CPMs or bids \n- increase / decrease freq. caps\n- add daily budget caps\n- expand or niche down on audience segments\n\nWithin a line you can go further and look at URL/app delivery. Block the worst URLs (performance or your own deemed quality).\n\nUse common sense too. If your budget is being thrown at a dubious mobile app getting 100% completion rates but something seems off - it probably is. You may have to override the KPI optimisation with strategy / governance.\n\nBe clear on your main KPIs, use efficiency (e.g. CPM, CPCV) and engagement (e.g. VCR, Viewability) to balance actions. And develop your own opinions over time to identify low quality inventory that presents good metrics.\n\nSome campaigns only need a small direction push, and mostly you'll want to monitor delivery. So you don't always need to change lot of granular settings. \n\nGenerally the more you block, the less flexibility the bidding model has so you don't want to unnecessarily inhibit your delivery.

As they've very much gone the trust our algorithm and optimized bidding solutions.

This pretty much applies for most optimizations, list of sites, GEOs, audiences, device-types, creative sizes and so on.\n\nJust start experimenting with pulling some data, monitoring what trends you observe that outperform your KPIs and splitting this into separate line items and see what it does to overall IO/campaign performance.

Also if you look at it at exchange level there are some exchanges with over 10%.  It doesn't look like it is directly related to bidding strategy. There are campaigns set up with optimise towards conversions. We have all the brand safety settings from either IAS and DV for bot traffic. We do have a extensive blocklist on all our campaigns. Impacting high quality sites as well not just long tail.\n\nIt is also hard to say it is a specific exchange as it is higher than what we usually get across the board. However, there are some exchanges that are higher than the rest.\n\n  \nUpdate: There is almost no in-app inventory.",

There are a few key steps to get it working properly:\n\n* First, make sure your DV360 account is set up at the advertiser level to support dynamic creatives. This means mapping the data creative profile to match your BMC feed.\n\n* In BMC, ensure that product details are always up to date before sending them to DV360. This includes product availability, price updates, and other key data. DV360 should automatically pull these updates to reflect changes in your ads.\n\n* Check that the feed is correctly captured in the Resource / Dynamic Creative section in DV360. This is where you’ll see the data being processed.\n\n* When adding creatives to your line items, select Dynamic Creative Ads. DV360 offers a few basic templates to format your product feed into ads, but you can also upload your own template using Google Web Designer or Studio.\n\n* You can set up feed rules to make the ads more dynamic. For example, if an item is on sale, you can highlight the promo, or you can show specific products to different audience segments based on predefined rules.\n\nThis setup can be a bit overwhelming at first, but once everything is in place, the real opportunity begins. Optimizing ad conditions and targeting to ensure your ads are shown in the most relevant way is where you’ll see a real uplift in performance. Advanced analyses and scripiting to implement such logic can be very helpful.\n\nOne more thing, bear in mind that feeds information in DV360 aren't necessarily real time, so if you want to check for every change you make, you might have to wait for a few hours.",

      "content": "TTD got shellacked today from earnings yesterday. The call itself sounded like the ramblings of someone who has no idea what is going on. Constantly repetition, selling Wall Street on scrum counts, praying DV360 gets spun off and saves their growth for another year. \n\nWell today it looks like Wall St heard all that and said fuck this mess, we’re dumping our money into AppLovin. They see AppLovin as the next Facebook because AppLovin has focused on performance advertising for mobile apps and is allegedly going to open that up to SMBs. I’m skeptical that they can pull that off, I don’t see SMBs trusting a random ad tech company that sounds like it’s name is a bad play on a Judd Apatow joke, but Wall St is gonna fuck that chicken for a bit and they bought more time with it today. \n\nTTD down 30% APP up 24% in the same day. APP is worth 4x TTD today. \n\nSo the future of Wall St investment in ad tech is performance. Well programmatic can’t compete with FB and Search on that front. They don’t own any inventory. Strength for neutrality but a kick in the balls for economics and performance media math. \n\nSo what’s a tech company to do to make the street happy? Time to get into the oil business. \n\nEssentially TTD is a refiner: they don’t own the mineral rights, but a lot of folks that do will send their oil to TTD for processing. Problem is the pipelines they have in place are hitting capacity. Sure you can shift some oil going to another refinery over to your (DV360 losing Google benefits) but that doesn’t change the total oil you have access to. \n\nAnd looking at the last year, Wall St loves to hear the refinery tapped into more oil pipelines. \n\nIn May of last year, TTD got a nice boost in their share price from one simple announcement: Netflix. An app with minimal supply and supply that TTD was sharing with DV360 made a nearly 15% bump in a matter of days. \n\nJeff talks about the TAM for TTD being $1T. Well sorry man, but no that is not your TAM. That $1T includes linear, Social, and Search/YouTube which you can’t touch. In fact those are the majority of that TAM. 20% of it is Meta and YouTube alone, of which YouTube is $30B a year globally. $30B. As in almost 3x what TTDs total global spend is. \n\nNetflix inventory? Maybe $50M. It’s a wild guess. But that tiny rounding error to the Global advertising industry is worth 15% to the stock price. How much would an untapped $30B market be?????? \n\nNow I know what everyone’s saying and yes, it’s almost impossible. Except for one gap in the Google Armor: Influencers. \n\nYouTube isn’t produced by Google, it’s a distribution and auction platform. No one wants to go compete with them on the distribution front, granted, but that latter front is an unchallenged market. As in the same kind of unchallenged market digital media was when programmatic kicked off its journey over a decade ago. \n\nYou’ll never lobby Google to open up the inventory, but influencers could have standing to sue Google into having to do so. Influencers are being ripped off by Google every day that goes by. Every impression on YouTube is essentially valued the same in their auction logic. A YouTube channel with pubescent teens making farts noises is getting the same auction value as a fully produced piece of content from another channel that took months to create. Why? Because Google has tried to artificially keep CPMs in YT low to keep the dollars flowing for their growth targets. They keep opening up more and more inventory every year to more and more channels and more and more formats. So YouTubers are making most of their money off of the platform by custom sponsorships and selling merch. \n\nBut what if the channels making the best content could actually be valued higher than the channels making dick all content? Why can’t that happen now? Because YouTube is as much a monopoly against the influencers as it is against the advertisers. \n\nSo you could goad the influencers to start taking legal action to force the issue on their behalf but that is like herding cats. \n\nOr you could centralize your efforts in one push: Spotter Media. \n\nThose guys have paid a boat load of investor money ($1B) buying the future rights to YouTube channel content. They say they have a solid business model, but color me skeptical. Maybe they are the JG Wentworth of influencers, but there’s no chance in hell JG Wentworth would pass on the change to increase the interest rates of the annuities they bought upfront. They have a lot of hold on a lot of content, and they stand to return a lot more money to their investors and themselves if they can increase the CPMs that content is generating. \n\nSo go drink that milkshake Daniel Plainview. Figure out which straw you want to use, but start drilling now. Even if you tap a 1/3 of the inventory in YouTube, you’ve potentially doubled your global revenue in one year. The ad format is the same, it’s the largest CTV app there is, and you save this stock growth for another 5 years at least. ",

If anything Google helps it stay somewhat alive but people much prefer apps over browsers.  \n\nI don’t entirely follow your DV360 or YT influencer arguments. YT is old and has found ways to stay increasingly relevant. \n\nI think TTDs ID approach is risky and not meant for the long run. Hashed emails joined from “open web” properties, pass. TTD desperately wants its own inventory and data but their whole shtick was the opposite. \n\nTake my notes with a grain of salt. I’m a decade plus ad tech veteran who is grumpy about the state of the world. If I was an advertiser or investor, I would focus on  vertical ad solutions.  \n\nSide rant, the mainstream open web is garbage today. Ads… ads and more shitty ads. I spend more time on discord or YouTube premium than any other domain. I grew up during peak early 00’s internet and witnessed Web 2.0. I prefer LLMs over some curated blog or news domain because the experience is without ads. Again, grumpy elder millennial who doesn’t use tik tok or instagram or shorts.

Q4 revenue reached $741 million, up 22% year-over-year but below the projected $759 million. Despite the miss, full-year 2024 revenue hit $2.4 billion, a 26% increase. The Trade Desk has set a Q1 2025 revenue guidance of at least $575 million, projecting a 17% year-over-year growth.\n\nCEO Jeff Green attributed the revenue shortfall to \"execution missteps,\" not market conditions. The company is responding with a major reorganization, streamlining client-facing teams, and doubling down on brand-direct relationships via joint business plans. TTD is also prioritizing internal effectiveness, scaling operations, and adding senior leadership.\n\n- [TTD Earnings Presentation - Q4 2024](https://investors.thetradedesk.com/news-events/presentations/default.aspx)  \n\n\n**IPG Ends 2024 on Soft Note After Q4 Decline**\n\nInterpublic Group (IPG) ended Q4 2024 with a 1.8% decline in net organic revenue but managed a slight 0.2% growth for the entire year. With a forecasted 1% to 2% organic revenue drop in 2025 due to client losses and a transformational program promising $250 million in cost savings.\n\n- [Read the full article on MediaPost](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/403347/ipg-loses-ground-in-q4-posts-slight-growth-for-20.html)\n\n**AppLovin Sales Forecast Beats Estimates on Ad Growth Surge**\n\nAppLovin's ad sales surged 73% year-on-year, boosting last quarter's results and leading to a strong revenue forecast for the next quarter that surpassed analyst expectations.

Senators Marsha Blackburn and Richard Blumenthal have sent letters to ad tech companies like Amazon, Google, Integral Ad Science, and DoubleVerify, as well as organizations like the MRC and TAG, demanding answers about how these ads bypassed online advertising safeguards. The investigation was triggered when Adalytics, while working on an unrelated project, discovered these instances on file-sharing websites.\n\n- [Read the full article on AdExchanger](https://www.adexchanger.com/marketers/lawmakers-demand-answers-from-ad-tech-vendors-allegedly-monetizing-csam/)\n\n## Advertising & Marketing Innovation\n\n**Disrupting the Metrics in TV Advertising Measurement**\n\nIn today's fragmented TV advertising landscape, the complexity of measuring viewership has increased with the rise of streaming services, challenging traditional TV ratings that drive ad costs. Nielsen faces competition from firms like VideoAmp, Samba, iSpot, Comscore, and Luminate, which use big data from set-top boxes and smart TVs to estimate ratings, but discrepancies and data integrity issues remain. As the industry seeks a universal metric for reliable measurement, the pressure for accurate, standardized metrics becomes crucial, especially with Nielsen's pricing sometimes exceeding the advertising revenue of cable channels.\n\n- [Read More on The NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/business/media/tv-ratings-streaming.html)\n\n**Bloomberg Bolsters Contextual Advertising and Expands into FAST Channels**\n\nBloomberg Media is enhancing its advertising strategy by expanding into free ad-supported TV (FAST) channels and launching AdService, which focuses on contextual advertising across TV, streaming, and digital platforms.

      "content": "Hey everyone! I’m going to share my thoughts below, and I’m hoping to get some opinions. \n\nWhen creating reports (daily, weekly, post campaign, etc.) to send to a client, I believe there are two main ways to aggregate the data by day. \n\nOption 1: Aggregate by Conversion Date (timestamp of the pixel fire)\n\nOption 2: Aggregate by Impression Date (timestamp(s) of the impression(s) that the conversion is attributed to)\n\nI can see both of these being useful for different cases. \n\nConversion Date is great for the “big picture”, can be insightful for clients to better understand their customers. They can see the days of week, times of day, and date ranges where the bulk of conversions occur. This is can be insightful, but mainly for purchases and other very low-funnel actions. Conversion date/time seems far less insightful for a site visit pixel. I can see this being valuable for a campaign manager/trader as well. You can heavy up during the “high conversion” time periods, trying to steal attribution as close to the conversion as possible. While this is a common tactic, it’s really just for the traders, and something they certainly wouldn’t want to share with their clients… so pretty irrelevant for this conversation. \n\nOn the other hand, Impression Date is great for optimization. If there is a clear trend showing that impressions delivered at “4-7pm on Sunday” drive an extremely low CPA, a trader can optimize on that and share the insight with the client. Or maybe it shows the week leading up to a particular holiday got a ton of attributed conversions, and the client should heavy up their budget there next year. IMO this is more insightful because impressions are controllable. Also, it allows all conversions to be tied to a date within the campaign flight dates. Aggregating on Conversion Date will result in a bunch of conversions falling outside of the campaign range, which can be a lot of it’s a large lookback window like 30 days. The downside to impression date is that the data changes over time. If you send the client a weekly reporting, it will need to be cumulative every time as even the previous weeks will continue to generate conversions until the lookback window closes. \n\nI also want to note that I’m aware conversions can be tied to many different impressions depending on which attribution model is used. But in those cases, they would simply split as they would according to the model. I just referred to it as a singular “impression” for sake of simplicity.\n\nOverall, I think Impression Date is more relevant and appropriate as a standard, and then adjust to conversion date when relevant. Of course, the client may have a preference and that would be the answer. But I’m mainly discussing what the standard could/should be. \n\nWould love to hear thoughts from others on this. Thanks in advance!",

I lost a lot of respect for Google when they deprecated their service level almost entirely. Google is officially a pay to play space, where only the largest of advertisers get a direct line into Google. Resellers add additional fee on top and is an extra layer of people to go through just to get “let us talk to our team at Google” as an answer to most questions.\n\nTTD at least feels like they are designing a platform that serves the little guy as much as they do the big guys in the space. Features like the S&P500+ and some of the newer brand safety/verification tools available off the shelf, in my opinion, are helping smaller agency’s and buying teams take out the MASSIVE amount of work that inventory curation takes to execute properly. Are they perfect solutions? Absolutely not. Am I optimistic and hopeful about the direction they are moving the platform? absolutely.\n\nAll that to say, Googles data, as black box as it is, is still robust and rich. And as long as YouTube remains in the Google walls, it will always have a purpose.\n\nTo me it felt like TTD leaned into emerging formats over the past 5+ years in a way that DV just simply did not. In a programmatic world where just display and OLV no longer cut it, I want a platform that invests in developing good CTV, DOOH, and AUD capabilities.",

      "content": "Hi, everyone!\n\nI’ve been facing an ongoing issue with budget allocation in YouTube campaigns on DV360, and I was wondering if anyone has found a better solution. We run brand-building and reach campaigns, where we need the budget to be somewhat evenly split—for example, around 60% on bumpers and 40% on nonskip/longer formats, so that the brand and the message is shown with longer non-skip and you get reminded of the brand with bumpers.\n\nRight now, bumpers are spending like there’s no tomorrow, while longer formats are getting pushed back. The split often ends up around 90-95% on bumpers and only 5-10% on longer formats, which is just not acceptable. Our current workaround is basically a band-aid solution—manually turning off bumpers from time to time. And just to clarify, the issue isn’t a low target CPM.\n\nI've reached out to Google support, and the suggested solution was to split bumpers and nonskip ads into separate line items. However, that doesn’t really work for us. We need both formats to work together—especially in lower-budget campaigns, where frequency could end up being driven entirely by bumpers, which isn’t the goal. The core of our campaigns is longer, nonskip formats.\n\nIs there any elegant way to control the budget split within a single line item?",

Combining that with their cookieless targeting, you can get super low CPM and drive actions just based off volume.\n\nIf you are looking for a more holistic dsp with different 3p audiences, contextual tools, and solid support staff, StackAdapt can do pretty much all the things pretty well. Yes, their fee isnt transparent, but their CPMs are generally comparable to TTD and you can get added value for your spend.",

My teammates are extremely programmatic savvy since we all came from agencies, but our innovation is more in line with what was hot 5 years ago. I would say the major downside is the growth potential is just not there like it is at an agency or a sales org. I think it really depends on where you want to go in your career next - like are you ok with being at the same level/role for multiple years, or are you trying to grow and be higher up at an organization?

In my experience, the only way that comes close to working is with a ~5x-7x frequency + strict dayparting of 8pm-10pm. TV watching during that time is more active than passive.\n\nFor performance marketing on CTV, you’re better off working with a DSP that has a cross device graph and can attribute CTV exposure to on-site activity / conversions / purchases.\n\nYou’re welcome to keep the QR code on the unit, but make the scans a tertiary metric after View-Thru conversions and VTR.",

Pick a platform that has access to as many channels as possible.\n\nI’d recommend starting with retargeting. CTV isn’t search where you can just target a high intent keyword and then expand from there. Retargeting allows you to get early insights and understand where performance is coming from at a low cost to then expand from it.\n\n45s creative won’t be approved on most inventories, you should try to cut it down to 30s.\n\nThere are a couple platforms that can provide that with the leading ones being Vibe, Mountain and TVScientific.\n\nHappy to answer any questions you might have.",

I'm a journalist covering adtech and media.\n\nI'm doing some reporting on AppLovin's impressive financial growth over the last year or so, and I'm examining why short sellerts have made AppLovin a target of late. Have been speaking with media buyers, adtech experts, financial analysts, and investment bankers.\n\nBasically, I want to know: what is it about AppLovin that's causing short sellers to circle? Folks like Edwin Dorsey at The Bear Cave and Lauren Balik on X have been vocal about their concerns re: misconduct and even potential fraud at the company, and these are interesting claims worth investigating.\n\nHowever, outside of these allegations, my aim is to take a higher-level look at investor behavior. What signals are short sellers generally looking for? What might have alerted them to AppLovin? Is it as simple as meteoric rise in stock price and skepticism around the sustainability of this growth rate? Are there other factors at play?\n\nDM me with your thoughts. We can arrange to be 'on background' for preserved anonymity. Happy to privately share email/Signal.",

A 30x revenue multiple is extremely high, especially for a company that's transitioning into a \"pure advertising platform\".\n\nYes, their financial growth looks strong, but a lot of that growth was fueled by expanding beyond gaming advertisers into e-commerce and finance brands. But there are still hurdles with mobile gaming inventory—brand safety, fraud, and attribution concerns make many advertisers hesitant to invest.\n\nOn top of that, competition is fierce. If mobile gaming ad spend truly scales, Google, Amazon, and The Trade Desk won’t just sit back and watch—they’ll adjust their offerings to stay competitive, just like they did with CTV. Not sure if their moat in the mobile gaming space is strong enough.\n\nFuture short seller triggers: Advertiser demand slows on mobile gaming ads, bigger DSP aggressively moves into mobile gaming, or some sort of Adalytics audit that uncovers ad fraud or brand safety flags (PR nightmare).\n\nAlso, it's probably part of the wider trend of overhyped tech stocks getting hammered lately.",

All DSPs now are preaching “transparency” so I’d really prioritize:\n\n1) ease of use (do you have ads or need them made?

High budgets still require skills, but they allow you to fail and test&learn, which you can't do with small budgets.\n\n\nIf your goal is to try programmatic because you want to learn along the way without having specific targets to hits, then that's a fair objective (i.e. gaining in knowledge and up skilling).\n\n\nMy humble advice if you're too small and with limited or no programmatic knowledge: 1/get an ad server 2/directly deal with the publishers that reach your audiences. Yes, it might be a bit more expensive (in money and time), but you diminish the risk of fraud and buying crappy traffic (which end up more expensive).\n\n\nI'm sharing this knowing that I'm pro programmatic, pro in-house, pro dsp. I certainly don't recommend working with small DSPs. They've got to pay the bills and the investors (or the other way around if unlucky), and they don't care about the traffic they buy, which can permanently damage your brand.",

A few things here:\n\n\\- You can look for an actual programmatic role, but another angle on this is stay for a bit longer (or no harm if you don't land a new/better role right away) and use that \"experience\" (the time) as leverage to maybe lateral or move one step up. You will finally get good experience, but also easier to get that job\n\n\\- There are roles that may entail of a few disciplines, but programmatic is one of the more robust/difficult ones to understand and become an expert in (maybe some aspects of search). You can do a couple good years of programmatic and move into a more general digital space. However, programmatic you operate in an open internet across many channels within. Lots of flack everywhere, but especially those walled gardens (Meta, etc.) you would be more tied to. People on the social/search side pretend they can just easily move into programmatic and that programmatic isn't transferrable (maybe more to social) to their channel. I have seen more people try to switch to programmatic from social and it is a bigger flop since somehow programmatic people are understanding of certain transferrable skills even though not to the extent to get into programmatic (just from my observation).\n\n\\- If you know people or can volunteer at a capacity to do some other social/digital work to slowly up your skills in that over time in order to switch or even see if it is something you actually like. \n\n\\- Keep working on those certifications\n\n\\- I don't want to sound annoying if this has been tried or a dynamic with your boss/team that I may not know of, but hopefully you have asked/brought up your desire (practically a need) to do some actual work. Even if it is a thing they show you, then you do in front of them. Sometimes there really is not the most work to go around in certain accounts, but if you have a decent rapport with your manager and they aren't the worst person on earth (though they may not be good at managing from the sound of it), it at least shows you tried. You can sleep knowing you put your best foot forward and if it is a no from them, then you showed their true colors and you can move on emotionally/physically.\n\nHopefully this makes sense.

Even though your doing data entry, you're doing something related to programmatic, so all you got to do is try to understand all the things that you do at atleast theoretically.\n\nFor taxonomy: understand what are all the words that they use in a target/placement.\nbrunello-pg_gumgum_hosted-15seconds-video-italy\ntake the above for example. and simply ask chatgpt: my company is running a campaign with this placement name, help me understand it with breakdown.\nSo next time when a similar placement comes in all you gota recognise is\n\nbrunello - is a clothing brand, we're running campaign for.\npg - is the type of inventory we're running the campaign.\ngumgum - is the inventory partner that's giving us the supply.\nhosted - you give your ad tags to gumgum, and they'll deliver it from their end.\n15sec video - is the type of ad we're using for this target.\nitaly - is the country we specifically running this campaign.\n\nFor QA process the same, ask chatgpt every field that you QA. just understand what that field is used for.\n\nSo basically start with the understanding the basic things, don't wait for anybody to teach you. This is everything that you gota do to get to next level.\n\nAfter this when you interview for other other companies, all they are going to ask you is if you understand the basic concepts in programmatic. Atleast if you have an idea of it.\n\nProgrammatic is intresting when you see the flow of impressions - what happens before/during/after with inpressions. Just by understanding things alone you'll easily be at the top 20%. and you'll be a huge demand either agency/ in house.\n\nUnlike social/search programmatic is not easy to learn, so feel fortunate & fully utilize the access you've got now with programmatic.\n\nHappy journey!",

I can drop the PDF somewhere and PM it to you, but in it, it says:\n\n* **Measure True Performance With Cross-Device Verified Visits** Once your ad is served, Cross-Device Verified Visits tracks the viewers’ IP address and device IDs. If those IDs visit your website—in a window of time defined by you—it counts as a visit both in Performance TV’s reporting and Google Analytics. That means once a user completes an ad, it allows you to tie visits, conversions, and other key metrics to your campaign— giving you total insight into direct-response performance.\n* **Full Google Analytics Integration** It’s important to track and verify your performance from non- clickable Connected TV inventory, which is why Cross-Device Verified Visits is fully integrated into Google Analytics. We create a real-time map of all devices within a household that touched your website or campaigns, and send it to Google Analytics to ensure proper attribution using the Google Analytics Measurement Protocol API.\n\nSo I think this is what you're seeing, since there's no way to click a CTV ad.  And since they mainly do retargeting, they're obviously going to drop your ad in front of people who will convert anyways, so the impressions may be largely non-incrememental.",
