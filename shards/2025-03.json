It was a project we worked on here and there and we finally finished it but we want to figure out a unique offer that would be useful for agencies and brands so they can use it. We were thinking of doing a free white label and offering additional dev services at a low cost to tie in whatever DMPs or other analytics agency clients want to use (we already track a lot of the player activity so that's included) and then coming up with an extremely affrordable SaaS model that would be far cheaper than any kind of rev share or high CPM based fee. This can be used on all devices including CTV. We can even tie in an ad fraud pervention analytics solution as well.  Is anything about this approach potentially useful? I figured if agencies and brands had their own player it could go a long way to eliminate wasted ad spend. I know there are other player options which is why I was thinking the customization piece would help. Thank you all for reading my post!",

If you look at what Jeff says on earnings calls and in the Kokai Edge Academy videos, he believes he can do your job better than you can with this new UI. Technically that was also true of Solimar at first when they had you go through the new campaign set up wizard. In both cases, it is an excessive amount of Hubris to tell a client you know their job better than they do. He implies that the software will find new buying opportunities for traders that will meet goals and increase spend. Yes he doesn’t seem to bother to recognize that the vast vast majority of people logging into and using his software are low level data entry ICs who have no input and no budget authority whatsoever. \n\nMaybe that’s why they’re so gung ho on going client direct, but what does he think is going to happen when he has a client with no programmatic experience login to this convoluted UI that tells them very little and requires 5+ clicks to see anything meaningful? \n\nSo in that, maybe these cases will have merit if they show that TTD leadership is flying by the seat of their pants (that 15 point plan sure sounded like it on the earnings call), and that they were taking out of their ass about Kokai when really all the internal data showed a totally different picture. It would be ironic as can be if the man who trumpets data in philanthropy ignored data in his multibillion dollar enterprise but I wouldn’t be shocked",

There are specific audiences we want to reach, but for the sake of not getting too much in the weeds, they are often broadly defined and we are not using a data onboarder like Liveramp to use the same exact audience for planning/targeting/measuring everywhere.

We track site visits, but don't rely on site conversions for sales purposes like an e-com advertiser would / don't have hard ROAS goals that you can plug and play into a buying platform or something like that. We use a few main measurement platforms as our central place to measure all partner activity.\n\nThere is a lot of talk of the need for clean rooms in advertising for planning/activation/measurement.

They want to measure which ads drive the most conversions but third-party cookies are no longer reliable due to browser restrictions and privacy regulations.\n\nSolution: LiveRamp RampID Matching via a Data Clean Room (DCR)\n\nA user clicks a Google Ad and visits the e-commerce website. They log in or make a purchase, linking their activity to the brand’s first-party CRM data. Data Matching via RampID ,Google assigns an anonymous Google ID to the user. LiveRamp assigns a RampID to the same user based on the brand’s first-party data the two IDs are matched in a privacy-safe way via a clean room. The advertiser queries matched impression & conversion data to see which ads performed best.\n\nSQL Query to Measure Matched Ad Conversions\n\nThis query counts the number of matched conversions by ad campaign.\n\n    WITH Matched_Users AS (\n      SELECT \n        adh.google_ads_campaign_id AS campaign_id, \n        COUNT(DISTINCT adh.external_cookie) AS matched_conversions\n      FROM `adh.google_ads_impressions_match` AS adh\n      INNER JOIN `project_name.dataset_name.customer_data` AS cust\n      ON LOWER(TO_HEX(adh.external_cookie)) = cust.rampid\n      GROUP BY campaign_id\n    )\n    \n    SELECT \n      campaign_id,\n      matched_conversions\n    FROM Matched_Users\n    ORDER BY matched_conversions DESC;\n\nSimilarly you can do much more things in privacy safe way  like building audiences, custom attribution model,  report on viewability metrics.\n\nAmazon DSP also has its onw DCR named as Amazon Marketing Cloud which also uses SQL.\n\nIn short you absolutely need it, hate it or love it, you cannot ignore it for sure and you will miss alot of data as cookies will become useless anyway 40-50% data will be lost, tanginle use cases  can be many depends on your ability to write SQL -you can do regression based modelling, markov chain analysis for conversion modelling, custom audience building.\n\nEvery marketer by now  must accept that cookies are going away, client side tracking is ineffective , 3rd party data is dying - so server side tracking, first party data, customer match, clean rooms, conversion api, conversion modelling are the future... marketers will have to learn new tech skills  python sql cloud computing, ML etc\n\nThere is Red pill and Blue pill - choose your pill wisely\n\nThere are many clean room service provider Ads data Hub is offered by Google , AMC by amazon DSP, Data bricks also offers one, SnowFlake DCR - but I prefer Ads data hub as it is integrated with BigQuery and Google DSP...If you explore it more you will be able to find many use cases that will set you apart from traditional marketers to modern tech savvy marketers..\n\nRefer the Product Docs of Ads data hub and for AMC >  [https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/overview](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/overview)",

The traditional podcast listener is SUPER engaged, seeking out a specific episode, downloading it, and listening to the entire thing, often only exposed to a few ads within an hour. Many of the publishers out there are cramming in 20+ ads an hour which is not appropriate for podcast content as it isn't like radio which is formatted for a lot of little chunks of content interrupted by ad breaks.

When I started in the role (1st job in advertising) Programmatic Solutions Consultants were one of the biggest partner teams I collaborated with, and over the last 3 years I have come to be very fascinated with what they do, and have learned some theory and basics of programmatic advertising and it interests me greatly. The way my current role is designed, I have learnt very little of campaign set up and execution, (since everything is done by Ad Operations team) and next to nothing of campaign management since I am not involved with connecting with the client to give optimization/delivery/strategy advice.  \nI am looking to move into the PSC role, but those teams only work from EU/APAC/NA (i am based in India) so I am forced to look for jobs outside my company, but there are not a lot of openings. I am going through job descriptions of roles that interest me, but they have a LARGE list of skills required such as:  \n\\-Skilled in multiple DSPs like TTD, DV360, ADSP  \n\\-Advanced Excel/PowerBI/SQL  \n\\-Some asking for experience with SSP, DMP, Optimizations\n\nI honestly do not know where to begin my learnings as I am starting from scratch. I have gone through Youtube playlists, and have learned the basics of the programmatic ecosystem, and I have seen tutorials of DV360 and ADSP Walkthroughs, but I don't know how to put the learnings into practice and develop it as a skill. If anyone would like to mentor me and/or give any tips or advice, I welcome you to share your thoughts!\n\nThank you so much in advance for taking the time to read and reply. Appreciate it as I desperately try to build a career in something that is hopefully my passion! :D ",

Although I haven't worked across MMM since very early days and when I was in house so I'm not sure where that lies but from personal experience I am skeptical of the value mix to how many currently invest.\n\nAlso further to moving away from post click is the value of Programmatic moving away from 'RTB' and being a pure acquisition channel. The movement to Curation and tight site lists I'd expect a shift of Branding activity to move away from direct IOs and move into Programmatic pipes.\n\nThere is a lot of potential in the future of programmatic but it's not going to be going 'backwards' to vanity metrics.",

          "body": "This is a great discussion and one that's being had even at the IAB level for reclassification of some media to CTV-DOOH or something similar.\n\n I think coming from the DOOH side there needs to be some open and honest discussion so buyers know exactly what they are buying for sure. In my opinion we have outlived the DOOH label and not everything can be lumped into DOOH as they are drastically different. Example we operate a DooH network with full site sound and motion that could in theory be used by CTV and OLV buyers if they are looking for extra supply to extended and reuse the creative they already have on another screen yet we are compared to a digital billboard, transit or taxi-topper screen that are static.\n\nThis is a critical issue that the industry is grappling with—how to properly classify and position digital OOH inventory in a way that aligns with evolving buyer expectations and media planning strategies. The current DOOH label is too broad, encompassing everything from digital billboards to fully immersive screen networks with sound and motion, yet buyers often view all DOOH inventory as the same.\n\nOur network’s ability to support full-site sound and motion makes it far more aligned with CTV and OLV campaigns than with silent transit screens or roadside billboards. This is where reclassification, such as CTV-DOOH or an equivalent term, could help bridge the gap between traditional DOOH and video-first advertising channels. It would allow buyers to better understand what they’re getting and potentially open new budgets from digital video and programmatic buyers who wouldn’t normally consider DOOH.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, one challenge is that many buyers still think of DOOH primarily in terms of impressions rather than audience engagement, whereas CTV and OLV buyers are accustomed to metrics like completion rates, viewability, and interactivity. \n\nUltimately standardizing measurement around video-based engagement metrics (e.g., dwell time, audio-on impressions, etc.) could help differentiate high-value DOOH networks from the more static formats but 100% the buyer should know what they are buying.",

I'd also recommend subscribing to some very good resources like Ad Tech Explained or Ari Paparo's Marketecture newsletter for more big picture industry news. In addition, the IAB has some decent courses as does U of Digital that may help if your company is willing to sponsor your education. Lastly, I'll add to remember this feeling and take the time to invest in those who come after you. If you can find a good mentor, they can really change the course of your career and paying that forward is not only rewarding but ensures the next high performer who comes along doesn't quit the industry because no one gave them the time and attention they needed.

Expiry settings in DSPs can decimate the precision of segments with high rates of change (think recent movers, recent visitors, in-market propensity). By bringing the data in on the supply side, there are more opportunities for good data to succeed and with minimal work by the buyer. The Deal ID doesn't change so the campaign doesn't have to modified; the segment IDs can be dropped and replaced on the back end to cut down staleness (and theoretically improve performance).\n\n2) Throttling rates sure, but also the presence of a deal helps with traffic shaping to fit more opportunities on your audience within any QPS limits. This can help a buyer better reach their target audiences (by optimizing opportunities to bid on them), and this in turn can help data companies provide a more performant segment (because they might not need to model up as much in order to provide the needed campaign reach).

If you have the means and the know how to operate the curation platform on your own, the math will never add up.\n\n- if you can implement your own SPO strategy, and strike these deals with SSPs, then there is a lot of savings to gain.  A clarification here is that, for maximum savings, you are HoK end to end.  You can rely on a curator with an SPO deal to cut some of the overall costs, but it dilutes the overall savings.\n\nEdit: one thing about pubs - they care only for volume.  They don’t look at it as “we only get $x.xx, when they could more”; they look at it as “we can get $x.xx when we were not going to get anything at all”.

Great question indeed as OP mentioned.  \n  \nDCO does indeed optimize existing assets by dynamically changing the elements within the asset (the image, the text, the CTA, the colours, etc.) based on specific criteria and data in order to show the most relevant ad to the user.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, one of my clients is an airline company. They have over 200 destinations and our job is to dynamize the ad so it fits the user that it is being shown to. The ad contains multiple origins and destinations, the price of the tickets, other texts and a CTA. All of these elements are dynamic. So let's say user A is located in Paris and we know this thanks to his IP address. We can use this to make it so the departure city is Paris. So we would have Paris-Amsterdam, Paris-Milan, Paris-Rome (the destinations are chosen at random). Then, via an API connection to the client's database, we know the price for each ticket in real time and we can show that in the creative.\n\nIt's important to note that DCO does not need to always show products. One of our clients used DCO with geolocation and weather data to show different landscapes (snow, beach, mountain, etc). The images used for this campaign were AI generated :)",

This space is so dense and I’m doing the work of 3 people already. I don’t want to waste our clients money, but I also don’t have the luxury of time to learn how to buy direct at the moment. Hopefully the agency hires on people to do what I do full time so I have the space to learn soon. I’m wondering if any one else has been in this position or could offer some advice.

Or they are just outsourcing to a managed vendor and tacking on multiple layers of fees. A managed programmatic vendor who actually specializes in programmatic is what you need. That said, there are plenty of trash vendors who pretend they have technology and make big claims, but operate as black boxes with no transparency and rake huge margins buying garbage.

No clue why this is/was the case, but that's what was communicated to us.\n\nThe off-site product, basically then just used their retailer data to target these identified as in-market users against what I can only presum was the bidswitch SSP supply. Based on campaigns I ran and reports received, the quality of what you buy isn't great (verified using 3rd party and human checks) and there was no solid attribution model proving incrementally. Based on this we saw no proof running these strategies drove incremental value, outside of the BAU programmatic activity, so we stopped running it",

It looks more straightforward, you don't need to waste all displays until winner is calculated, and it allows more easier understanding by business. Why ad platforms don't use it instead of t-test A/B testing? Or perhaps they do? ",

If someone is more generous than I,  I'll give my upvote.\n\nBayesian don't come without challenges. Typically, if there's no historical data (which is unlikely given all the data one can have access to), the results can be misleading.\n\nAnother concern can be the cost, but again with all the cloud computing one can have access to, it shouldn't be a concern.\n\nBig plus for bayesian is that the optimisation can be done on the go, hence why it's useful not only for AB.",
