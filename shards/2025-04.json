      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\n**Context** \\- I do my media buying in GAM and I work with a third party company for my DCO campaigns. They send me javascript ad tags split per format and per audience segment that I integrate into my campaign. The creatives are adserved on their end. Right now, I tend to have one line item split per format and per audience segment (Line item 1 - Car intent, Line item 2 - Electric cars, Line item 3 - Diesel, and so on) as I have different creatives for each segment. Sometimes the images will change, or the text inside, or both.\n\n**Goal** \\- I am trying to optimise the number of my Line items by not splitting them per audience segment. The goal is to have one Line item for my 300x250 (for example) and put all my audience segments inside.\n\n**Problem** \\- I don't know how I can send the info to the third party company so they know which ad to show to the user. How would they know to show the Car intent creative vs the Electric cars one? Are there any GAM macros that can be used to pass on this information? I saw the %%PATTERN:key%% macro and I think that might be the answer, but I don't quite understand how that works. Any help would be greatly appreciated and sorry if there's information that's missing. Do let me know if you need clarifications 🙏\n\nThanks!",

The actual GAM ad slot on the publish web page needs to pass the value based on the page content, user, etc. then GAM can pick up on the key value. \n\nNot sure you can coordinate this as a media buyer, if I’m understanding your situation correctly.",

I am not the one responsible for it though, so I don't have any more info on the dev / website settings side of things.\n\nSo, just to see if I understand this correctly, for example, I have 2 creatives for my Line Item 300x250 based on 2 audience segments - Electric car and Diesel car. I could create a macro %%PATTERN:targeting%% that returns either Electric car or Diesel car, based on the user the ad will be shown to. \n\nThen, I can share this macro with the third-party company who manages the creative and they would add in their script blahblahblah**&targeting=%%PATTERN:targeting%%**\n\nThen, once a user comes to my website, GAM will recognise this user is in the Electric car segment, GAM will then pass that info via the macro and the latter will be replaced dynamically by \"Electric car\" on the third-party company side. Once they see \"Electric car\" on their end, they will know to show the corresponding creative.\n\nIs that how it kind of works or am I very far off ahahha?",

          "body": "An example of how we used this at a previous company is: \n\n1. The content authors would tag content they wrote with certain information (topic: cars, brand: toyota, etc) in the Content Management System they use to publish articles.\n2. Our dev team wrote some code to dynamically insert those values from the Content Management System into the Targeting parameter in the GAM ad slots/tags on the page.\n3. The info (topic = cars, brand = Toyota) is then passed into GAM by the ad tag and available for targeting or potentially DCO.\n\nI’m not a dev but this is an example of an ad tag I found that is being set to pass gender = male and age = 18-34 to GAM. \n\ngoogletag.cmd.push(function() {\n        googletag.defineSlot(‘/1234567/adunit’, [728, 90], ‘div-gpt-ad-123456789-0’)\n            .addService(googletag.pubads())\n            **.setTargeting(‘gender’, ‘male’)** *// Example: Passing ‘gender’ and ‘male’*\n            **.setTargeting(‘age’, ‘18-34’);** *// Example: Passing ‘age’ and ‘18-34’*\n        googletag.enableServices();\n        googletag.display(‘div-gpt-ad-123456789-0’);\n    });\n\n\nSo the all the macro does really is create an opportunity to pass some kind of text value in the ad call. It’s up to your dev team to develop a system that’s sets those values and up to the DCO company what they’re capable of doing with those values and the Pattern macro in their code for the creatives.\n\nFull Disclaimer: I’m not a dev so this is just my understanding of how it works",

We've been told by the agency we work with (who uses DV360 and TTD) that they won't run anything for us without a $200K minimum ad spend commitment. Obviously, that's a bit steep for us - so is there a platform / DSP I can access on my own (whether paid or unpaid) that I could go around the agency and buy CTV placements on our own? Would there still be minimum spend requirements even in these cases? Would love to learn more. Thanks to any kind programmatic person who knows more about CTV than I do :)",

It helps you figure out what’s blocking impressions, it could be budget pacing, targeting issues, or even creative approvals. It's super useful when something looks off.\n* **Prebid** is all about making sure your bid actually has a shot before it enters the auction. It helps optimize bids based on floor prices, past performance, etc., so you’re not just throwing money away.\n* **Targeting** is where you set up who sees your ads. Think audiences, geo, device, all that good stuff.\n* **Creatives** are the actual ads (banners, video, native, etc.) you’re running.\n* **Audiences** are the groups of people you’re targeting. You can use first-party data, Google’s audience segments, or even third-party data providers.\n\nHope that helps! DV360 is solid once you get a feel for it. Lmk if you have any questions.",

I asked ChatGPT on how this could affect the industry and here’s what it said:\n\n1. Withholding Taxes on Cross-Border Ad Spend\n\nIf countries impose withholding taxes on payments to foreign ad platforms:\n\t•\tA brand in Brazil buying programmatic ads through a U.S.-based DSP might have 10–15% of its payment withheld.\n\t•\tThis increases costs for buyers and may shift demand toward local or in-country ad platforms.\n\nImpact: Foreign DSPs become less competitive; brands may prefer domestic platforms to avoid extra tax burdens.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Data Localization Requirements\n\nMany countries (e.g. India, China, Russia) require data about local users to be stored or processed within their borders:\n\t•\tThis increases infrastructure costs for global ad tech firms.\n\t•\tIt also limits the ability to centralize audience targeting, analytics, or optimization algorithms.\n\nImpact: Less efficient campaigns, higher operating costs, and difficulty in maintaining global product parity.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Market Access Barriers\n\nSome countries could:\n\t•\tRequire ad tech firms to register locally, share code or IP, or form joint ventures.\n\t•\tRestrict certain types of data-driven targeting for foreign platforms (e.g., political or behavioral ads).\n\nImpact: Global expansion becomes more complicated; smaller ad tech companies may not have the resources to comply and exit markets altogether.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Government Preference for Domestic Providers\n\nGovernments might:\n\t•\tMandate that public sector ad buying go through nationally based DSPs or SSPs.\n\t•\tImpose certifications that favor local vendors.\n\nImpact: International players lose access to public sector budgets or face longer sales cycles.\n\n⸻\n\n5. Pressure to Repatriate Revenue or Pay Digital Services Taxes\n\nSeveral countries have implemented digital services taxes (DSTs) targeting revenues from foreign digital companies (e.g., France’s 3% DST on digital advertising revenue from large platforms).\n\nImpact: Even if not called a “tariff,” these taxes function similarly—eating into margins and creating accounting complexity.\n\n⸻\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf countries impose tariff-like rules on services:\n\t•\tGlobal ad tech becomes more balkanized—with fragmentation of data, tech, and access.\n\t•\tCross-border efficiency suffers, especially for targeting, optimization, and measurement.\n\t•\tCompliance and legal overhead rise, favoring the biggest players (Google, Meta, Amazon) who can afford to adapt",

Now they’re just getting the raw macro text ($%7BCAMPAIGN_ID%7D) in Analytics instead of the actual campaign IDs.\n\nBased on experience with Google’s ad platforms, this could be due to:\n\n1. A silent update to how macros are processed between these platforms\n2. Changes in the macro syntax requirements (possibly requiring different encoding)\n3. Permission/account linking issues between the DV360 and CM360 instances\n4. Changes in how UTM parameters are being passed to Analytics\n\nPossible solutions might include:\n- Checking if macro syntax needs updating\n- Verifying account linkages between platforms\n- Testing alternative macro formats\n- Contacting Google support for confirmation of any changes",

Most SMBs and even larger companies in my market (Norway) are hesitant to move away from direct deals with publishers – which honestly still baffles me.\n\nMost of our clients need to be “warmed up” through channels like Google Ads, Meta, and other walled gardens. Once they see solid results there, I use that momentum to explain how Programmatic works – including the use of first-party and third-party data for targeting.\n\nI’ve been in the game since 2020, and the COVID years were actually some of the best for Programmatic in Norway.\n\nI launched my own agency in March 2024. Since then, I’ve tripled the number of clients for other services – but our core Trade Desk client group has stayed relatively small (though loyal).\n\nEvery single client has come through referrals. I’ve considered hiring salespeople, but haven’t needed them so far thanks to strong word of mouth.\n\nTalent is extremely hard to find. Most skilled professionals are tied up in the larger agencies.

I'd say the programmatic agency side has changed quite a bit. Back in the early days the larger agencies including holding companies were more open to partner with other smaller agencies, this has changed and that opportunity I would say is more difficult today. Meta and Google as you know dominate the digital ad market across agencies, advertisers (small and large). So you'll see a lot of advertisers pick their agencies based on those skills (plus SEO, marketing automation, content/creative). Focusing on programmatic only will put you in a position where you will normally have customers that either have an additional agency for paid search/social or do it in-house. So you can expect to have customer relationships where you are very specialized. And then you can of course add to it then that those agencies who specialize in search/social could add in some programmatic to their offering as well. \n\n  \nMy recommendation would be to specialize in a vertical. Go very deep into a specific sector (and combine with a geographic area). You could for example be incredibly specialized in e-commerce, gaming, fashion, pharma or any other vertical. Then become really really good at that one. There is a good say from Michael Porters classic books on strategy which (very simplified) says you can either be cheaper (which is difficult), or you can be different / better. So I would say go for different / better and to be that these days you need to specialize in something. If you want to go into multiple industries / sectors then maybe you should have multiple agencies.",

It'll be hard for you to expand internationally if you keep recruiting there. And if you're struggling to hire locally, that's another reason to do it internationally. There's talent everywhere.

It doesn’t measure *value* — it measures *clickiness*. And the most clickable inventory? Usually low-quality stuff like cheap entertainment sites, mobile games with fat-finger clicks, or spammy placements designed to generate accidental taps. Optimizing to CTR often means you’re buying the worst of the internet.\n\nIf your goal is performance (sales, signups, visits, etc.), CTR is a vanity metric. It’s not predictive of downstream action. In fact, studies across multiple DSPs (DV360, TTD, etc.) show that **high CTR rarely correlates with conversions**.\n\nNow let’s talk about your **deal setup**/**inventory.**\n\nYou mentioned this is a *non-guaranteed deal* — that means you're likely getting remnant or auction-based impressions from a curated pool. But if the **deal inventory isn’t top-tier (think either Niche Sites that fit your targeting or things like NYT, WSJ, Disney, etc.)**, then you're just paying more for average or bad supply. A possibility could be inventory provider has probably improved their ad placement to get fewer misclicks so thus fewer clicks?\n\n“But our goal is 1.25% CTR!”\n\nThat sounds like a KPI made up by someone who doesn’t understand how programmatic media works. That’s not a dig at you — it’s extremely common. Most people working in media don’t realize that optimizing display is as much about **supply path quality, identity resolution, frequency control, and outcome alignment** as it is about getting clicks. \n\nAlso, optimization 101. I want more clicks, I was getting that last month. So run a report seeing the difference MoM (Ad format, Sites, Environment, Device) what are the differences - things you can control? if none, then now look at things like did supply placement within the site change, did creative change drastically - things outside your control.",

Native forces you to include copy with your image, and most native doesn’t want your logo. So the copy has to convince the customer to click and learn more..and thats the other part of native that people miss. It used to be content discovery, and thats still where its value is. Pay off what the copy says in the page it clicks through to. Continue to build up the why before you ask the consumer for a form fill or a purchase. \n\nDm me if you wanna chat.

Whether you're buying open exchange inventory or via PMP/PD deals you get very little transparency beyond domain/app level reporting, as you are dependent on what publishers are passing back through the bidstream. Maybe if you buy via PG with a larger pub you can ask for a series/show level report and if you're lucky they will provide. \n\nYou can also hardly decide which shows/series you buy on, again unless you're buying direct via PG.",

Some marketers have latched onto the concept of \"buying groups\", which targets individuals included in a buying journey, versus the end game person who signs a contract. In this concept, buying groups are great to reach across programmatic, because you're trying to build awareness for your brand so they influence the end buyer....if you go into programmatic trying to reach only the end buyer, you'll be disappointed in your results.",

          "body": ">In your experience, have you seen certain B2B niches or verticals where programmatic *does* work well? Or does it mostly make sense when paired with a strong retargeting or ABM strategy?\n\nIf by \"work\" you mean generating leads, no, not really. Programmatic could still be relevant for brand awareness within B2B audiences. As per u/[OrdinaryInside8](https://www.reddit.com/user/OrdinaryInside8/) comment in this thread, programmatic in B2B often targets behaviors rather than job titles, which means you might reach individuals who aren’t decision-makers—like junior employees. Still, building brand awareness among them can be valuable, as they may become future buyers as they progress in their careers. This might be particularly true in some industries or professions. For instance, consider an industry where precision and accuracy are critical, such as pharma manufacturing or clinical instrumentation. In these cases, establishing a brand known for those qualities can offer long-term advantages.\n\n>if B2C is such a better fit because of broader audiences, more data signals, and a simpler conversion path. Is trying to push programmatic in B2B even worth it for most brands? Or should it only be considered when there's already a strong base (like solid CRM data or a long-term content strategy)?\n\nAs per the above - brand awareness can be important for B2B brands, so programmatic should be considered. B2B companies need brand awareness just as much as B2C, yet this is often overlooked, with B2B marketing frequently reduced to mere lead generation.",

It's hard to make an impact on 4-5 figure budgets without seriously narrowing geo. \n\nCPMs are higher than almost every other media so impressions are lower. You're also almost always better off also including Pre-Roll/Display for retargeting CTV viewers as running CTV alone is less effective.",

Tatari is strong if you’re looking for a more managed-service model with linear + CTV and advanced incrementality tools. Vibe is pretty turnkey and works well for brands that want fast setup and don’t need deep customization. TVScientific is interesting too—leaning more into a performance-driven, self-serve approach with integrations into platforms like Google Analytics and some ecom tools.\n\nI’m the founder of [AdLib](https://getadlib.com), which we built to give brands more control without the usual constraints—no spend minimums, credit card billing, and direct access to premium inventory with support for contextual and program-level targeting. We integrate natively with Triple Whale, Northbeam, AppsFlyer, and Kochava, so measurement stays centralized and clean.\n\nIf you’re building a stack around flexibility, and performance, happy to share more.

Fill rates also softened, falling from 42% to **38%**, indicating more selective buying and stricter ad quality standards.\n\nTo navigate these challenges, **publishers should focus on high-value ad formats**, **leverage first-party data**, **optimize floor prices**, and **strengthen direct deals** to stabilize and grow revenue.\n\n**CPM Trends:**\n\n* **MoM Growth:** Display CPMs ↑7.4%, Video CPMs ↑61.1%, overall CPM increase of 12.1%.\n* **YoY Change:** Display CPMs ↓35.9%, Video CPMs ↑12.3%, overall CPM decrease of 29.6%.\n\n[Check out the full report](https://databeat.io/blog/us-programmatic-trends-april-2025/)",

Break down how the ecosystem works—who’s involved, how ads are bought and sold—using a clear, real-world analogy. Keep it straightforward, no fluff or jargon.\n2. **Teach it like I’m a seasoned industry pro** Let’s get into the advanced stuff: the underlying mechanics, the hidden levers, who the real players are, and how the value chain actually operates from end to end. Where are the bottlenecks or inefficiencies, and what parts of the process are ripe for disruption or improvement?\n3. **Coach me like a mentor** Walk me step-by-step through how to plan, launch, and optimize a successful programmatic campaign. What are the key decisions I need to make? What common mistakes should I avoid? What blind spots do even experienced marketers tend to miss?\n4. **Think like a strategist** Put programmatic in the larger context of media, marketing, and business growth. How does it connect to other channels? Why does it matter more than ever? Where’s it headed next?\n5. **Summarize like a top-tier consultant** Give me a concise, reusable cheat sheet I can use to teach others or revisit when I need clarity—bonus points for frameworks, flowcharts, mental models, or quick-reference principles I can apply right away.\n\nPlease include real-world examples, cite references where useful, and anticipate the confusing parts. I’m looking for clarity, depth, and speed—so I can walk away with both confidence and practical know-how.",

The main goal was actually to generate ad copies generation according to their customer persona.\n\n**Process & Idea**\n\nTo keep it short here are the main cases we worked on:  \nStep 1 - Build quick customer persona\n\n* Either from scratch\n* From existing purchase data collected from site visit, purchases, etc.\n\nStep 2 - Select Ad format\n\n* Easy format: Search Ad copies\n* \"Hard format\": DIsplay Ad Copies (banners)\n\nStep 3 - Generate Ad Copies Variants\n\n* Generate half a dozen of ad copies per persona\n* Customize headline, core text, CTA and / or background image according to persona characteristics\n\nEventually, we implemented everything (manually) into Google Ads & Meta. We had a single campaign, with one ad group per persona with all the corresponding creatives. Mmaybe we should have had one campaign per persona with a specific targeting? Not sure, sounds like over-engineering.\n\nWe also implemented a campaign with the same set-up but only with a few ad copies and a single ad group (basically what my friends would have done without my help).\n\n**Outcome**\n\nGot +25% CTR, -13% CPA (purchase event), cost of production is almost an estimate but we estimated -50% versus fiverr or upwork freelancers, time of production once the script was ready was like -90%.\n\nGot a few ad groups that performed really well, so that did super bad, hopefully the one performing well compensated for the low performance.\n\n**Question**\n\nSo obviously first results sound very promising for sure. But that's only for a couple of small brands, where the testing set-up might be challengeable.\n\nAnd there are might be more complicated cases to handle.\n\nWhat's your feeling on that? Do you think brands could be interested? Small ones, big ones, agencies? I just feel we had something interesting between our hands, but also super early stage / raw code assets.\n\nNot sure what do with that next and whether it could benefit more media buyers.\n\nHappy to take feedbacks.\n\nCheers",

I recently resigned from my job in programmatic advertising for an Uber project, where I only gained about 0.6 months of experience. Unfortunately, we were using internal tools, so I didn't have the opportunity to learn much. \n\nNow, I want to gain experience with global programmatic tools like DV360 and CM360 etc. Prior to this, I worked in SEO and Google Ads for two years, but I am now determined to advance my career in programmatic advertising. \n\nThe problem is that none of the companies are hiring without 2-3 years of experience, which is incredibly frustrating. I spend each day applying for jobs, only to be rejected because I lack the necessary experience. \n\nHow am I supposed to gain that experience if no one is willing to hire me? 😭\n\nWhat should I do?",

If you worked in Google Ads for 2 years then that's your 2-3 years right there.\n\nMy humble opinion is that you need to be able to speak to Google Ads as a programmatic tool for display and video. It's not that much different to DV360 or any other DSP - if you understand the similarities/differences and can speak to it then as a hiring manager I could easily consider Google Ads experience as extremely relevant experience for any programmatic jobs.\n\nBut if you yourself don't consider that Google Ads experience relevant or have no way of explaining why it should be considered relevant then the recruiters/hiring managers are not going to make that connection for you.\n\nGood luck!",

The major DSPs offer this, though some might cost money nowadays.\n\nIt will not be as good as actual agency/hands on trading experience, but it tells the employer it will be slightly faster to train you since you already have at least the theory down.",

We’re relatively new in-market (~18 months) but do ~4-4.5 billion impressions/month from our product. The majority of our revenue is through open market programmatic. \n\nWe’re now starting to sell more direct and work more on PMP/PG buys. As we dive deeper, Comscore has come up in conversations with large agencies only once. \n\nI remember from my time agency-side, planners used Comscore and Nielsen but this was 15 years ago at this point—is it still relevant for media planners in today’s day and age? Do you use it to plan buys? If so, what are you looking at/for?\n\nThank you!",

I’ve worked at DSPs, SSPs and high impact partners and I’ve seen a lot of areas most clients could improve. I’m wondering if there are any sites that would be a good place to post my services? Upwork seemed decent but the pay to play system is a bit off putting.\n\nThanks!",

I've worked as a seller on DSP side and SSP side. \n\nfrom my POV, lots of Independent Agencies and Brands aren't identifying their key strategic media partners, vendors, suppliers, ssp's, data partners, etc. which means they're not unlocking cost savings, discounts, and improved media performance. \n\nsome call this supply path optimization, or spo \n\ni get it. they just don't have the bandwidth to do this.\n\nbut not doing spo could also mean they're running on lower quality inventory, MFA's, higher cpm's, etc. \n\nall that said, i'm wondering if anyone has any recommendations for SPO consulting opportunities? \n\nthanks for your help!",
