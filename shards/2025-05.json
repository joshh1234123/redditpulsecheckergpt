I remember messing with some campaigns and it was a nightmare not knowing which channel sucked.\n\nSpeaking of fees, The Trade Desk's tight spot must be rough, especially with Amazon DSP showing them up. If fees keep going down, maybe more folks can play ball in the ad game without breaking the bank.\n\nAlso, if you're into monitoring these wild ad trends, Pulse for Reddit can seriously help keep your finger on the pulse. I've tried different services, but it's perfect for engaging with the Reddit crowd and staying in the loop.",

I feel like platforms and traders often advocate for consolidation, but in my mind the fewer you have the less opportunities for optimization, and different supply has inherently different value that you would be bidding the same price for if not broken out. \n\nI'm getting pushback for wanting online video line items broken out by audience (2), instream vs. outstream (2), and mobile web/mobile app/desktop (3) for a total of 12 line items. I understand not having budget spread too thin across many line items, but that's not a risk here as the budget is significant. I would think separate line items for instream vs. outstream should be default for any advertiser so that bids can be assigned based on their objectively disparate value. \n\n I'm curious if there is any *actual* benefit from an auto-optimization perspective to have fewer line items with less restrictions, or if it really doesn't make a difference since the campaign will optimize between all the line items anyway.",

If it’s a brand awareness campaign, your standard metrics should be reach / cost per unique user (CPUU) reach, with completion rate as a quality check (i.e., CPUU of $0.02 means one thing if your completion rate is 90%+ vs if it’s 50%).\n\nYou could also do a frequency analysis, ideally looking at frequency distribution to understand how many people you reached 1x/2x/3x etc. per week, month, or flight duration.\n\nJust like with video, you could look at conversion metrics if your customer wants to track conversions, but audio is likely not going to show the best performance on a CPA basis so I would treat this as a secondary KPI if anything, not the primary objective of the campaign.\n\nTwo things you can’t measure on audio-only placements are click and viewability metrics. The caveat would be if you’re running on supply that accepts companion banners for audio (where you’re serving a banner alongside your audio ad). Hope this helps.",

It can optimise towards a specific CPA goal while maintaining target CPM and able shift budgets between line items. I know most of these can be done on the DSP's native algorithms and settings but we want to see if there are any other players out there other than their own Algorithms and Scibids. \n\n  \nThanks for your suggestions in advance.",

Do you use any kind of QA checklist? Do you get someone else to double-check things before launch? Any tools or templates you’ve found helpful?\n\nTrying to figure out a smoother process, would love to learn what others are doing.\n\nEdit: I contacted AtomicAds, and they gave me a 14-day trial.

I would recommend creating your own QA list first before buying into a tool.

The easiest way to go about creating one is take a peak historically what’s been set up and look for a pattern and combine that with information for your campaign setup (you of course generalise this in a sense - has correct audience targeting been applied vs have you applied in market for land-mowers audience). And for QA you’re absolutely not going line by line if you have an option to bulk review or edit. If you have the preset for same geo for example across lines, it’s enough to check if one has it applied, and when you download the sheet you can cross-check the rest of them easily.\nAnd after you’ve done all that, you can bet you probably missed to check something.

Kokai UI is a mixed bag, some really nice workflow improvements and some real head-scratchers. They are still actively updating it, it's clearly not in its final form.\n\nIn terms of Koa and AI features specifically - pretty surface level. You can choose which \"dimensions\" you want to have Koa optimize (device type, creative format, etc etc), which it optimizes towards based on the goal that you have set (ie CPA). There is an activity log that shows you when Koa makes changes, but not specifically what those changes were. You can however click into each of the dimensions to see what the current bid factors have been set to. You can turn Koa on or off for each of these dimensions individually.\n\nThere is little-to-no flexibility aside form setting the goal you want it to optimize towards - you can't set any rules or parameters for it to work within and you really have no insight into how it's actually making decisions. This is my main complaint. Even the option to choose aggressiveness or acceptable bid range would be nice. Analyzing the actual changes is tedious in most cases. Some (very few) have the goal metric displayed alongside those bid factors natively in the UI, so you have to pull manual reports and compare the performance for each dimension with the actual bid factor Koa has in place. \n\nIn terms of the actual optimizations it makes, they seem to be... okay? You would expect the bid factors to reflect the actual performance of that KPI, but they rarely do. They aren't ever horrible, but they aren't really ever spot-on. But again, you can't really tell what factors beyond just the goal KPI that it's considering. Is it considering scale/available inventory for each dimension alongside the KPI? Is it considering how other optimizations relate to each other, like device type and ad environment? We don't know.\n\nAs it stands now, it's good enough to use, but wouldn't solely rely on it for optimizations. Hardly a differentiating factor. It may be getting fed data more efficiently with the Kokai update, but from a user perspective it's largely in the same form it's been for quite a while with a few more dimensions that you can apply it to.",

But lately, I’ve been getting curious about independent (indie) agencies — the smaller, more agile teams doing creative and performance marketing without the big corporate baggage.\n\nI’d love to understand:\n\nWhat really matters to indie agencies when it comes to digital marketing and programmatic campaigns?\n\nAre they more performance-driven, client-relationship-focused, or innovation-led?\n\nHow do their priorities differ from holding company agencies?\n\nWhich channels do indie agencies lean on the most — is it social (Meta, Insta, LinkedIn), programmatic display/video, search, influencer collabs, or something else?\n\nHow do they typically approach budgets and campaign strategy? Are they more experimental or cautious?\n\n\nIf anyone here has worked with or inside an indie agency, or collaborated with one on the brand/vendor side — your insights would mean a lot. Would love to hear what makes them tick, what frustrates them, and what kind of partners or platforms they vibe with the most.\n\nDrop your thoughts below — appreciate you in advance!",

Which translates to account manager to client ratio to get out of hand and employees are at most times overworked.\n\nHaving the experience of an indie agency, then later in large agencies, it truly felt that the \"We're so big\" attitude commonly seen in large agencies, you just feel..... dare i say they're so shit, never touched this, never tried that, zero experience with such and such, because their contracted scope just do not cover the skill and they could just look good because of the logo, but skillset wise, they do suck.\n\nBut, when employers hire, they do look for the big logo to hire, so the logo helps with leaving the scene, but to learn real skills and experience, definitely indie.",

The biggest key is actually setting the CPMs high enough as this would be an expensive buy.  \n\nYou can also try and get shoulder coverage (less expensive) that would target the soccer shows before and after games.   \n\nSo talk to your DSP of choice OR CTV buying agency and you can get it done fairly simply. I can hook you up with one of our sales people BUT if you already have a DSP seat just ask them for EPL coverage CPMs and options.   \n\nHonestly- it would be much more cost effective to target EPL watchers WHO are relevant to your brand with CTV and other tactics. Blanket target EPL would probably not be as effective as targeting the right audience. But it depends on what you are doing and your brand.",

Living in GAM every day, I still waste a shocking amount of time bulk-creating line items, creatives, and the like—so I’m exploring a *very* lightweight tool to fix that pain.\n\n**Why this post?**  \nBefore I write a single line of code I’d love to sanity-check the idea with real practitioners. I made a **6-question Google Form** (takes \\~3 minutes, completely anonymous). It covers:\n\n* how many campaigns/line items you set up\n* how you currently handle bulk edits\n* what frustrates you most\n* whether you’d ever pay for a no-frills bulk-editor\n\n👉 **Form link**: [https://forms.gle/Pr5C9LgjijNBZBb19](https://forms.gle/Pr5C9LgjijNBZBb19)\n\nNo sales pitch, no follow-up calls—unless you *want* to chat in writing later (optional field at the end).\n\n**What you get:**  \nI’ll share an aggregated summary of the results with the subreddit next week so we all see whether this is a widespread pain or just my personal nightmare.\n\nHuge thanks in advance! Feel free to roast the idea or drop additional thoughts in the comments.\n\n*(Mods: if this type of survey isn’t allowed, please let me know and I’ll take it down.)*",

You will also have to think about the UI challenge - does each integration have their own set of screens (more maintenance) or share the same screens (more consideration for compatibility)\n\nBased on your list, I’d avoid create and editing campaigns and ad groups beyond simpler use cases, like budget management.  Once get to ad groups, each platform describes the same feature differently.  These features are also most likely to change over time.  This may lead to breaking changes, and people will just go back to the platform.\n\nWhen thinking about reporting integrations, you’ll want to think about your data model.  It’s tempting to just grab all the data you want and dump it into one table, but that will result in longer processing times and user frustration.  \n\nTackling budget management, pause/resume campaigns, automating campaign shell creation (name/budget), assigning creatives, and actionable insights (e.g. ad group A is driving a lower CPA, shift more budget here) are good initial use cases, and touch features that are usually stable and mature.",

BUT with that you can target CRM lists, retarget website visitors, etc. A good way to use that smaller budget is to augment your sales staff. Taking lead lists and current deals in the works and targeting the leads from those. Or piggybacking off of email marketing by target email lists with display ads.  \n\nAnother thing is to not really worry about frequency as IT folks will need to see that ads 10-30 times before engaging.  \n\nI have worked on a lot of IT based B2B saas and it works really well most of the time.

          "body": "This is from a TTD perspective. \n\n1. Accept you likely won't see incremental lift and think about your next step if that happens (more on this below) \n\n2. Try to ensure you're not running concurrent activity in the platform that *isn't* part of the test/holdout groups or you'll risk contamination muddying results. This also goes for activity outside of the platform which you don't really have control over. If your results are not significant, see to what extent contamination may have occurred \n\n3. Ensure your audience targeting cross device methodology matches your conversion lift methodology (TTD will always use an XD graph for your testing/holdout conversion attribution). I.e. if using person cross device for your lift experiment, use person cross device for your audience targeting \n\n4. If your raw data shows 'negative' lift - ignore it and treat it as no lift detected. TTD uses a one sided t-test, it's not testing for negative lift \n\n5.  You'll need to select a primary conversion event, but if you have literally ANY other conversion point then add them to your campaign (i.e. site visits, site behaviour events...). TTD will measure lift against all conversion events applied to a campaign. This way if you don't detect lift on your primary event, at least there may be other indicators of behaviour lift \n\n6. If you do not drive overall lift, look into the data to see if there were any pockets that did see significance. TTD measure lift at an overall test/holdout level, campaign level, ad group level and device level. NOTE: Any insights here should be treated as *directional*. The reason being that there will be overlap between these dimensions, i.e. a person could be in campaign A and campaign B so these insights won't be entirely clean. As you'll get results weekly, you can optimise your campaign based on these results. \n\n7. If you do see insights like the above, you can verify this by running further testing in the form of **multi-cell tests**. TTD's multi-cell experiments allow you to have more than one test/holdout group where no single person can be in more than one cell. Meaning you can cleanly test for specific hypotheses (i.e. does campaign A drive more lift than campaign B?) \n\n8. TTD won't deem any lift as 'significant' unless it has a p-value below 0.1 (90% confidence) and is above the minimum detectable lift. If you want to be more lenient in your confidence levels you can increase this to whatever you want, for example an 80% confidence level by accepting lift with a p-value of 0.2. Google for example will report on a hierarchy of confidence levels, where as TTD will give 'significant or not significant' \n\n9. Make sure your campaign is set up in a way you'll most likely drive lift, this is usually in the form of quality delivery. I.e. prioritise viewability, above the fold, completion rate, pre-roll, non-crappy sites etc...\n\n10. Make sure your exclusions are as robust as you can POSSIBLY make them. Exclude all previous converters from your conversion events, but also push through CRM data to further bolster this exclusion \n\n11. Work with your TTD reps to get frequent data reports. They are generated weekly but currently aren't accessible through the UI/reporting so they can send them to you.",

I have literally 8k clicks in Xandr, but only 2k sessions in Ga4. Plus, the bounce rate is so low, at 5%. \n\n\n\nMy suggestions are 2:\n\n* Ga4 is considering them users that already have interacted with my client's website, so thats why it doesnt atribute the other 6k (so high anyways) users. \n* Ga4 is literally stealing from Xandr\n   * I spoke with my microsoft representative already, says a clicks on  xandr is a clicks, and the % of discrepancy is not normal.\n   * UTMS are well set also.\n\n\n\n  \nWhat do you guys think!?\n\nApart form obvious aspects, i think such a big discrepancy is not normal. Im literally reporting clicks for them since the difference betwees DSP and Ga4 makes it imposible to work otherwise.\n\n\n\nHappy to read y'all",

          "body": "Couples of questions and initial things to check:\n1. Are you using a 3P ad server to measure clicks independently of the DSP click reporting? You shouldn’t see a large click difference here, but could help you troubleshoot. \n\n2. Is your client utilizing a consent banner on their website / consent mode within GA4? Depending on configurations this would prevent ad tags / scripts from running, leading to discrepancies \nbetween platforms. On this note also check things like CSP policies as those can prevent scripts from running if not whitelisted.\n\n3. Review your session / engagement time settings in the analytics platform. Some clients will set their session metric to be a higher / lower time amount than others, so you need to see if that plays a factor. \n\nLastly, a reminder that a click doesn’t necessarily equal to a session, they are different metrics but like a previous comment noted - I’d personally switch from an ad click focused strategy as it’s too susceptible to fraud, click farms and potentially low intent users. You may be better off switching to a soft conversion strategy, where your display campaign is set to optimize off actions like ‘certain time spent on key pages, whitepaper downloads, etc.’",

Anyway...*\n\n\n\nSo, I've officially been the only Ad Operations Specialist at my agency for 3 or 4 years now. As far as I know, I'm the first person to hold that title, and it's a role I'd never heard of until my manager at the time told me that's where I would be doing going forward (started as a Junior SEO Specialist). I'm mostly self taught, but I think I'm pretty solid relative to what's asked of me. The problem I'm seeing is that I have no direction in terms of how to improve. As mentioned, I'm the only ad operations specialist, so there's nobody to really learn from. So my questions to you all:\n\n1. Generally speaking, what should I know/be learning?\n2. What is something ad ops isn't technically expected to do that's still good to at least understand?\n3. How much of what you know/understand depends on what's been asked of you in your role?\n4.

Year-over-year, CPMs declined 25%, reflecting a post-election dip in political ad spend and ongoing economic uncertainty. **Fill rates also dropped from** **42% to 38%**. Notably, **AdX saw a slight QoQ CPM lift**, bucking the trend, while **Amazon (-29%)** and **IX (-18%)** experienced the **biggest declines**.\n\nEarly in the month, lighter advertiser demand led to higher win rates, but bidding intensified mid- to late-month as budgets ramped up, peaking in the final days. To adapt, publishers should **adjust floor prices dynamically**, lowering them at the start of the month and increasing as demand surges, especially in the last 10 days. Leveraging **real-time optimization** and **diversifying demand sources** will be key to stabilizing revenue as market volatility continues.\n\n**CPM Trends:**\n\n* **MoM Growth:** Display CPMs ↑3.9%, Video CPMs ↓31.1%, Overall CPM flat\n* **YoY Change:** YoY: Display CPMs ↓29.7%, Video CPMs ↓13.3%, Overall CPM ↓25%\n\n[check out the full report](https://databeat.io/blog/us-programmatic-trends-april-25/) ",

Brand keywords. Perhaps even Direct. You can easily monitor this in G.Analytics and correlate with upper funnel.\nSame goes for other metrics: your CPA (lower funnel) should be gradually becoming lower, more effective - as a result of built awareness and recognition. \nYou may also agree to have some % of your overall performance to be measured by overall company success (sales, revenue) - to reflect your influence on it, but also the fact the influence is somewhat indirect.\n\nHope it makes sense.\nFingers crossed!",
