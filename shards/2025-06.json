There's a ton of jargon involved in programmatic, and I think once you start to get a grasp of how all the pieces fit together, it'll start making a lot more sense. \n\nRead up on ad exchanges, SSPs, programmatic deal types, ad inventory types, frequency management, etc., and use what you know about Meta and Google Ads to contextualize what's happening behind the scenes. Google Ads and Meta, for example, are just walled gardens that operate in a similar manner as what we think of as \"programmatic\" but they're confined to single platforms.\n\nThere are way more levers you can pull in programmatic compared to something like Meta or Google Ads to move campaigns in one direction or another, so having some understanding of all the different components in the space, even if you don't ever need to use some of them, is most important in my book.",

I'm finding that the general structure of programmatic vs. non-programmatic Campaign set ups are very similar as I'm doing more online trade-desk courses(dv360, Amazon DSP, Meta Blueprint, TTD). The main difference being targeting and method of optimization. \n\nOne of the few tricks that I know for sure that's translatable is to rely heavily on previously run campaigns if you're offered a view in it. I remember when I started out in ad ops, I heavily relied on existing or past orders regarding settings that are the same from campaign to campaign. It'll also cut down on your time needing to ask questions. \n\nGood luck and would love to hear how it's going just to hear from a perspective of someone just starting out and if it's something I'm able to do. \n\nGood luck!",

There's also a DOOH Planner tool that allows you to filter to specific screens and submit a deal request through the tool.\n\n  \n**Cons**\n\n1. Deal set up can be a bit manual, because it varies by which screens/placements you want. If you have a bunch of different SSPs/screen owners in a deal, it can be a little more legwork.\n\n2. Targeting doesn't have the same specificity as other channels like display and video. Things like f-capping, auction type, etc. aren't supported.

          "body": "Hey! It’s great that you’re helping your friend with their book publishing campaign on Amazon DSP. I’ll break down your questions with some insights from my experience in programmatic advertising, especially for ecommerce/book campaigns.\n\n1. Tactics/Targeting Strategies That Move the Needle in Book/Ecommerce CampaignsBehavioral Targeting: Use Amazon DSP’s audience targeting to focus on users who’ve recently browsed or purchased books in similar genres. For example, if the book is a sci-fi novel, target users who’ve shopped for sci-fi titles or related products (e.g., sci-fi movies, games).\n\nRetargeting: Set up retargeting campaigns for users who’ve visited your friend’s book listing but didn’t purchase. Amazon DSP excels at this since it leverages Amazon’s rich shopping data.\n\nLookalike Audiences: Create lookalike audiences based on people who’ve already bought your friend’s books or similar titles. This can expand your reach to users with similar interests.\n\nKeyword Targeting: Use keywords related to the book’s genre, themes, or even competing authors (e.g., “best mystery novels 2025”). Amazon DSP can target users searching for these terms on Amazon or across the web.\n\nSeasonal Trends: If the book ties into a specific season or event (e.g., a holiday romance novel), time your campaign around those periods and target users searching for related content.\n2. Audience Segments(Channel Mix/Third-Party Sites to PrioritizeAudience Segments:\n\nGenre-Specific Readers: Target readers of the book’s genre (e.g., romance, thriller) using Amazon’s category-based audiences.Book Buyers: Focus on frequent book buyers (both physical and Kindle) through Amazon’s purchase history data.\n\nDemographics: Narrow down by age, gender, or income if the book has a clear target audience (e.g., young adult fiction for 18-24-year-olds).\n\nChannel Mix:\nDisplay Ads: These are great for awareness. Use eye-catching creatives with the book cover and a strong call-to-action (CTA) like “Buy Now on Amazon.”OTT (Streaming): If the budget allows, OTT can be powerful for storytelling. Create a short video ad (15-30 seconds) showcasing the book’s premise or a gripping quote, and target streaming platforms like Fire TV (Amazon DSP supports this).\n\nMobile In-App: Books are often an impulse buy. Target mobile users on reading apps (like Kindle, Goodreads) or lifestyle apps where your audience hangs out.\n\nThird-Party Sites: Prioritize sites like Goodreads, BookBub, or literary blogs where book lovers congregate. Amazon DSP’s partnerships can help you reach these audiences programmatically.",

Do These Metrics Help Plan Future Actions?](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7318629227522650113/)\n\nAs suggested by the title of this article, we might have several questions about the effectiveness of our digital marketing campaigns. Depending on what we want to achieve, we decide which KPIs to consider. But are we sure that our key performance indicators are the most suitable for revealing the truth? To answer this question, we must always keep in mind our business objective.\n\nIn the previous example, does the metric answer the questions: Are we reaching the right audience? Is the message we are communicating truly effective? Are the channels we are using appropriate?\n\nWe can attract a high volume of traffic to our website, but it doesn’t guarantee a rise in online sales. In the best scenario, it might provide just a piece of information. The Instagram followers in the example above may therefore be considered a vanity metric.\n\nWhat are vanity metrics? They are metrics that are not directly related to the main business objectives and don’t provide useful insights about the possible actions we need to adopt in the future.Vanity metrics may look good in a presentation, but they lack substance. \n\nMeanwhile, always referring to the previous example, ROAS, ROI, and CPA can provide a better picture. These metrics might be considered actionable metrics because they align with the business objective and eventually indicate actions to take if needed.\n\nBut how can we distinguish vanity metrics from actionable ones? It all depends on our business objective and the context. Our metrics provide significant information when we consider the situation around them. Let’s say that our campaign works at the upper part of the purchase funnel. Its aim is to bring traffic to our website and build brand awareness. In this case, average engagement rates and the time spent by each user on certain pages would better indicate whether our campaign is achieving its goal. In this scenario, our KPIs would help identify which actions to take if needed.\n\nThe concepts of vanity metrics and actionable metrics are not new to the digital marketing industry, but this important distinction is often neglected.\n\nResuming, ask yourself these three questions: 1) Does this metric tie to our business goals? 2) Can this metric inform future decisions? 3) Is the context around this metric understood?\n\nAnd you what do you think? I would like to hear your opinion on this matter. I’m looking forward to read your comments.",

      "created_utc": 1749495602.0,
      "content": "Ad waste is a well known problem in the digital marketing industry, often nourished by MFA websites (Made for Advertising). MFA websites are those created exclusively with the intent to generate large quantities of bid requests to skim off the top of advertisers’ budgets.\n\nAs we will see later, these are neither negligible amounts of money nor insignificant percentages of impressions.\n\n# How can the adoption of vanity metrics incentivize ad waste?\n\nOften, brands and agencies use metrics such as CTR, CPM, and viewability as reference points. In general, these metrics are not closely related to the business objective, at least not directly. If brands decide to use these metrics to measure the success or failure of a campaign, agencies have little choice but to adjust to their clients’ expectations.\n\nOn the sell side, publishers are also affected by these choices because they, too, are pushed to create content that better aligns with CTR, CPM, viewability, and similar metrics; otherwise, they struggle to properly monetize their work.\n\nIt is within this vicious cycle that MFA websites find their space. And now, thanks to artificial intelligence, which previously required days, these websites can be created in mere hours. This has dramatically increased the number of MFA sites.\n\n# Do MFA websites involve only small publishers?\n\nActually, the record shows that MFA websites have been linked to well-known and prestigious names. The scandal involving the Forbes subdomain ([www3.forbes.com](http://www3.forbes.com/)) was even reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThere have also been cases where MFA websites were included in inventory sources within deals.\n\n# What are MFA websites?\n\nMFA websites are created solely to divert as many funds as possible from advertisers’ budgets. They generate an abnormal number of bid requests.\n\n# What are the characteristics of MFA websites?\n\nThese are the most notable traits:\n\n* Ad overcrowding (at least double the usual amount)\n* Ads that appear partially or totally overlapped\n* Low-quality content\n* Web pages refreshed frequently\n* Rarely appearing in search engines\n* Traffic sourced entirely from paid display, video, and social ads\n* Circumvention of frequency caps\n* Bid requests marked as viewable that actually are not\n\n# What are the ad waste numbers?\n\nAccording to ANA (Association of National Advertisers):\n\n* 15% of the annual global programmatic ad spend goes to MFA websites.\n* 21% of global programmatic impressions in a year are served on MFA websites.\n\n# Given these numbers, why does the industry still place so much importance on vanity metrics?\n\nIt’s a trade-off. Serving ads only on high-quality inventory would reduce scalability and increase CPM, two factors that agencies and brands are highly sensitive to.\n\nHowever, investing in high-quality inventory yields better results in terms of actionable metrics, those directly linked to a brand’s business objective. These metrics also provide valuable insights on what next steps to take, if needed.\n\nThere is no doubt that spending at least part of the budget on MFA websites helps reduce CPM and improve CTR and viewability. However, it also creates a poor user experience and ultimately harms brand reputation.\n\n# The steady decline in third-party cookie availability has made inventory quality even more crucial.\n\n# What can be done? Is the industry taking action to mitigate ad waste?\n\nFortunately, progress is happening!\n\n* Xandr and AppNexus have launched the Inventory Quality program to verify inventory source quality.\n* Tech vendors specializing in bid request analysis are developing new methodologies and standards to prevent ads from being served on MFA websites.\n* Industry bodies such as ANA, 4A’s (American Association of Advertising Agencies), WFA (World Federation of Advertisers), and ISBA (Incorporated Society of British Advertisers) have joined forces to establish a standardized approach for identifying MFA websites.\n\n# In summary, MFA websites and ad waste have finally been put in the spotlight.\n\nAdditionally, **programmatic players are growing increasingly aware of the issue.**",

Instead, it nobly serves to load 12 overlapping banner ads on a website called “Top 17 Life Hacks for Slicing Bread (Number 7 Will Infuriate You).”\n\nIn conclusion, vanity metrics are the breadcrumbs that lead us all into the forest of digital delusion.

Buying Ad units that people can see are more expensive, sure, but are they? Better ads and ad slots result in better viewability, higher CTRs, brand lift, and reduced frequency. Combine all that together and you get marginally more expensive CPMs.\n\nSomeday, someone will figure out that data and hyper-targeting over better creative is a big lie.",

My point is that you cannot measure the success of your campaign by relying solely on these metrics; they offer only a small part of the picture. In fact, I have seen many campaigns that use CTR as the primary KPI. While CTR can indicate whether your audience finds your ads appealing, it doesn't provide substantial insight into your campaign’s overall impact on user behavior. Moreover, CTR alone doesn’t offer guidance on what adjustments to make if your campaign needs realignment.\n\nFor KPIs to be actionable, they must be contextualized within your business objectives, even at the top of the purchase funnel. Similarly, CPM can be misleading if you're buying inventory from MFA websites, as these low-cost inventories are often of poor quality and can ultimately harm your brand.\n\nP.S.

Somewhere & sometime - all segments HAD a decent \"signal\" as an origin (like in the example above: \"person X bought a diesel truck\"). The issue is - such segments are super tiny and data vendors want to scale them (to sell them and make money), so such data (called \"deterministic\") is than applied to other persons, whi exhibit *some* similarity to original data-set. Now we have \"probabilistic\" data... and it usually SUCKS, but you are never told, what's truly inside.\n\nNow...\n\nThe way around it is to use simpler signals, but ones which are less likely to be modeled that way.\nFor your case - a few examples below. Not sure how good they are - your industry is really outside my expertise, so take it with a grain of salt.\n\na) geo-based signals. If diesel truck owners have specific behaviors - like regularly stopping on trucker gas/rest stations - you can target people who inherit ARE in such place (geofencing) or people who have been in such places (will be less precise, but better scale).\n\nb) targeting based on interests and intents - ideally based not on black-box 3rd party segments, but CONTENT, which such truckers likely 'consume'. Disclosure - this is the solution company I work with excellent at, so again - take it as it is).\nFor example: if you know your audience and are convinced that they regularly read about... portable camping equipment (IDK, I really have no idea...) - you can reach them with contextual solution - reaching people who interact(ed) with such content [interest or purchase intent]. This can be anything, of course. Perhaps due to loneliness, they often read about dogs. Or maybe about satellite phones. Or maybe they are avid barbecue/ grill lovers. You probably know, or can find out.\nWhen you do - target them based on their interests.\n\nc) lastly - perhaps this is a good case for some simple partnerships. Find someone who has a business NOT competing with yours, but is interested in the same audience. Do something together. Joint offer? Use each other's channel for promotion. Recommend each other's offer some discounts or benefits.\nI know - it's not programmatic. Old school, but certainly worth a try.",

When a deal sends bid requests to a DSP I know the DSP will only analyze 1/1000 requests and log that information, but will this sort of logic of only listening to a certain portion of bid requests also apply to bidding? So if I were leveraging a deal and the deal was sending out of geo inventory 80% of the time, would we exclude far more than 80% of avails because of sampling or would the DSP still listen to each and every request before deciding whether to bid/not bid?\n\nThanks!",

      "content": "After burning through hundreds of dollars on AI API calls last month (mostly using GPT-4 for tasks that GPT-3.5 could handle), I got frustrated with the lack of cost visibility and intelligence in existing AI dev tools.\n\n**The Problem:**\n- Most AI coding assistants hide costs until your bill arrives\n- You're using expensive models for simple tasks\n- No easy way to orchestrate different models for different purposes\n- Building custom AI workflows requires writing code\n\n**What I Built:**\nOctomind - an AI development assistant with real-time cost tracking and intelligent model orchestration.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n🔍 **Real-time cost display:**\n```\n[~$0.05] > \"How does authentication work in this project?\"\n[~$0.12] > \"Add error handling to the login function\"\n[~$0.18] > \"Write unit tests for this component\"\n```\n\nYou see exactly what each interaction costs as you go.\n\n⚡ **Layered architecture:**\nRoute simple tasks to cheap models, complex reasoning to premium models. All configurable:\n```toml\n[layers.reducer]\nmodel = \"openrouter:anthropic/claude-3-haiku\"  # $0.25/1M tokens\n\n[layers.primary] \nmodel = \"openrouter:anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet\"  # $3/1M tokens\n```\n\n🤖 **MCP server integration:**\nAdd specialized AI agents through configuration alone:\n```toml\n[mcp.servers.code_reviewer]\ncommand = \"npx\"\nargs = [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything\"]\nmodel = \"openrouter:anthropic/claude-3-haiku\"\n```\n\nNow you have `agent_code_reviewer()` available in your session.\n\n🖼️ **Multimodal CLI:**\n```\n> /image screenshot.png\n> \"What's wrong with this error dialog?\"\n```\n\nVisual debugging in your terminal.\n\n**Real Impact:**\n- Reduced my AI development costs by ~70% through intelligent routing\n- Can compose AI workflows without writing custom scripts\n- Full transparency into what I'm spending and why\n\n**Example session:**\n```\n$ octomind session\n[~$0.00] > \"Analyze this React component for performance issues\"\n[AI uses cheap model for initial analysis: ~$0.02]\n\n[~$0.02] > \"Suggest a complete refactor with modern patterns\"  \n[AI escalates to premium model for complex reasoning: ~$0.15]\n\n[~$0.17] > /report\nSession: $0.17 total, 2 requests, 3 tool calls, 45s duration\n```\n\nThe tool supports OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare providers with real-time cost comparison.\n\n**Installation:**\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muvon/octomind/main/install.sh | bash\nexport OPENROUTER_API_KEY=\"your_key\"\noctomind session\n```\n\n**GitHub:** https://github.com/muvon/octomind\n\nI'm curious what other developers think about cost transparency in AI tools. Are you tracking your AI spending? What would make AI development workflows more efficient for you?\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for the interest! A few people asked about the MCP integration - it uses the Model Context Protocol to let you add any compatible AI server as a specialized agent. No coding required, just configuration.\n",

      "created_utc": 1750084617.0,
      "content": "During my career, I have often seen CTR taken as the central metric to determine the success or failure of a campaign. Undoubtedly, CTR is the first metric we look at to see if our ads are interesting to our targeted audience. But does CTR tell us the entire story? For example, an ad might enjoy a high CTR because it is compelling or its imagery is eye-catching, yet if the landing page or offer doesn’t resonate with visitors, those clicks won’t turn into conversions or revenue. This can mislead marketers into believing that their campaign is performing well based solely on an impressive CTR, while the factors that actually drive business growth; such as conversion rate, cost per acquisition, and customer lifetime value (depending on the business objective); remain unoptimized.\n\nIn other words, focusing only on CTR; even as a tactic; ignores the crucial elements of the customer's journey, such as the user experience on the conversion path or the quality of the traffic being driven to the website. In essence, while a high CTR indicates that an ad is attracting attention, it doesn’t guarantee that the visitors are engaging with the product or service in a way that advances business growth.\n\nLooking beyond CTR to more actionable metrics; like conversion rate, customer acquisition cost, product page views, average time spent on those pages, and engaged sessions (to name a few examples); provides a clearer picture of what your campaign ultimately drives in tangible results. This shift from vanity metrics to actionable ones ensures that your optimization efforts are aligned with what truly matters for long-term success.\n\nA definition of vanity metrics versus actionable metrics that I like a lot is: good metrics should drive decisions, not distractions. Actionable metrics lead to real business growth, not just better-looking reports.\n\nSome may object that CTR and other vanity metrics are used in the early stages of the purchase funnel, and that they should be viewed as part of a global strategy that, in the lower funnel phases, also considers actionable metrics. But the fact is that vanity metrics can be used for short-term directional decisions, **yet you always need something in place to check the relationship with lower funnel value**; and correct it if necessary. Does an ad with a high CTR have a lower conversion rate than an ad with a lower CTR? It could mean that the ad copy, creative, or CTA; although attractive and clickable; did not accurately represent your actual offer.\n\n**As the saying goes, \"what you measure grows.\"** The metrics you choose as your KPIs will determine what you focus on. Choosing the right or wrong KPI will impact everything from your strategy and execution to the campaigns you run and the results you achieve. Hence, it is crucial to ensure that your KPIs are not vanity metrics but are meaningful and drive business impact.\n\n**Let’s return to the second question in the title: Does optimizing for CTR lead to serving on junk inventories?** \n\n**I would ask you to run this test**: If you have a campaign with a goal of increasing CTR and a conversion pixel implemented on the landing page that fires every time a user lands on it after clicking your ads, compare the number of clicks with the number of post-click conversions. Do the two numbers match? If not, how large is the discrepancy? According to playbooks and help center articles, a 20% discrepancy is considered acceptable. A discrepancy between the number of clicks and the landing page conversion events might be due to several reasons:\n\n\n\n* Slow loading of the landing page due to internet connection issues\n* Fat-finger errors on mobile devices\n* Pixel implementation issues\n* Third-party cookie restrictions or ad blockers\n* Users clicking on the ad but immediately abandoning the landing page\n* And many other reasons not mentioned above.\n\n\n\nBut what if the discrepancy is 30%, 40%, 50%, or even above 60%? **Mostly, such discrepancies are due to fraudulent clicks generated by bots**. In general, these malignant codes are situated on MFA websites; for this reason, it is very important to ensure that your campaigns serve on good quality inventories.\n\nOptimizing campaigns based on actionable metrics also means you are serving on good quality inventories. Even when discussing traffic quality, if you focus more on GA4 average time spent by users on product pages, it would consequently improve the quality of traffic (in terms of engaged sessions, for example). Conversely, if you want your campaign to maximize the number of clicks, the system might favor serving on inventories from MFA websites; which, although offering lower CPMs, provide a bad user experience and ultimately discredit the brand reputation.",

Technical feasibility: you hinted quite complex and different things you would need to achieve to get any reliable data to measure lift, that is to 1. have the capability to accurately isolate a control vs. exposed group, on top of 2. matching these users to offline retail or foot traffic data with 3. ad engagement (not even a form where you can capture email or phone number as a matching key). You are also mixing in a few different platforms/stakeholders (retailer, DSP(?), adserver, probably advertiser CRM data on top of it).\n\n2. Scale: you should expect to have a large media budget to obtain the expected data volume on this study to achieve statistical significance. I'm assuming you could use historical data related to engagement rates (on your CTV format, usually quite low) and match rates for location/POS data to that engagement, to try and calculate the media budget you would need to achieve volume. If it is a national campaign, I would expect a pretty massive budget. \n\n  \nGood luck!",

I know you posted 26 days ago, so reply back with updates if your campaign already rolled out! Also did I read in your other threads you just started a new product marketing role? Congrats!!  \n  \nIn any case, it's a great idea to establish a control group to understand the incremental lift of your ads. One thing I would ask of the partner/network helping execute the media buy or the measurement would be how that control group is established and what size it is relative to the duration of the campaign flight. You'd want that control group (the group not seeing the ads) to behave as similarly as possible to the exposed group pre-test, that way you can minimize noise and better isolate the true impact of the CTV campaign.  \n  \nAnother thing I would ask them is about a post-treatment window. Even though the format is 'shoppable', the CTV campaign might not deliver a lift in revenue right away, so it's a good idea to track the control group for a few weeks after the CTV ads conclude to see how sales trend across all your retailers.  \n  \nFull disclosure I work for Haus, a marketing science platform that helps brands run incrementality experiments to assess the causal impact of their ads.

I know the ad format metrics show which formats ran, but I’d like to go a step further and analyse how campaigns with multiple formats (combined formats) performed versus those where formats are split only one format.\n\nI’m working with a large number of campaigns, so any tips on how best to structure, pull the report or approach this analysis would be great. \n\nThank you ",

Multi-touch is only marginally better - still severely limited to digital-only ecosystems - where ALL your messaging and ALL your client interactions and ALL your sales happen online (practically never true).  \nEngagement? Not sure what you mean here, so let's leave it aside. This can potentially be a good directional indicator in some cases.  \nSales over longer time horizons... I mean... yeah, but the problem we are trying to solve with measurement is a RELATIONSHIP (preferably causation, not mere correlation) between advertising activity and \\[some\\] effect. MMM is the most robust method for building that relationship, but is infrequent, quite complicated and (often) cost prohibitive.\n\nMany discussions here (or other places) seem to ignore that most of advertising budgets come from brands with SIGNIFICANT portion of activity AND sales happening offline. These brands look for upper-funnel measurement for a reason. Brand lift may be flawed for many reasons but is an absolutely valid way to assess if you achieved something more with your advertising vs \"good VCR\".",

It allows for custom polygon creation to track and optimize store visit attribution. You can build audiences based on historical visitors to your own stores or competitor locations, all without needing a separate third-party location data partner. They use GPS and plat line data alongside geofencing tech, which makes it easy to activate proximity-based campaigns with built-in visit tracking.\n\nIf you're open to higher platform and data fees, The Trade Desk (TTD) recently rolled out its own geofencing solution through Kokai. While TTD doesn't offer deep native geofencing capabilities, it integrates with nearly every major location data provider, including PlaceIQ, Foursquare, InMarket, AdSquare, and more, through its Measurement Marketplace. It also provides access to real-time and post-campaign footfall attribution depending on the location data provider. TTD has superior inventory access, particularly with the Kokai focus on inventory quality, though most major DSPs generally tap into the same SSPs. If you go this route, it becomes less about TTD itself and more about the location data partners you choose, so I’d recommend scorecarding those providers based on your own criteria to ensure alignment with your goals.",

Custom more curated pre-bid requiring working with the 3rd party who will create a custom ID for you and push it to the DSP seat to use. The latter is x3 more expensive normally.",
