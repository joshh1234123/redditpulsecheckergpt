Consider a move to an adtech company, but in a partnerships, product manager or business development role. Depending on the company and the exact responsibilities, these can vary across company, they should give you skills that easily translate to similar roles at any company/industry. The benefit of that being that you don't have to take a lateral step, or even a step back when transitioning into an entirely new field as you leverage your programmatic skills and experience first to develop yourself in more general skills",

Is it straightforward stats and trends showing how your campaign is trending/improving as you've launched or do you also put together \"stories\" or  aha narratives every month to show what's working and what's not working and deep and dramatic executive summary type wins and losses each month?  \n\nMy problem with that approach is \"what's working\" is such a generic term and it's not like you're going to have a \"story\" every month. If something has a lower performance for a KPI you are tracking the beauty of programmatic is real time optimizations usually then don't spend as much towards that lower performing tactic (unless there are scale issues with other better performing tactics with just limited inventory or audience sizes). \n\nAnd when speaking of KPI's how do you get benchmarks for various campaigns such as a lower funnel campaign ROAS - mid funnel DPVR or page view rate as I never look at CTR's except when just measuring the difference in performance between a creative or audiences. I mean there are things that can have better results for one KPI but not for another so you don't want to say that other thing isn't \"working\" in totality.  \n\nI've already had this conversation with Chat GPT just curious what some real world programmatic peeps like me do - or if you have an awesome analytics department that handles dumbing down reports for high level executives with MBA degrees, ha.",

If you are dealing with c-suite, or a not-so-knowledgeable director/VP who has to communicate up to their C-suite, they need you to write them a story. It’s less about ‘here’s what is/isn’t working’ and more about looking at each data point and asking WHY. If you can give them decent hypothesis on why the tactic you cut wasn’t performing but this other is, or why performance improves on Tuesdays and Fridays, or whatever, THAT is what they are dying for (and the difference between reporting and analysis).",

      "content": "Hi, r/programmatic!  I'm feeling a bit lost, and seeking advice on next steps for my career. \n\n  \nA little about me:\n\nI am a partnerships manager at an ad server/SSP tasked with growing my partners' programmatic ads businesses through developing and executing data-driven yield strategies across web, search, and mobile app ecosystems. My responsibilities include being a trusted advisor, providing best practices and guidance on our ad products/platforms but my overall objective is to drive revenue for my partners and for the Company. I'm in a senior role, which has given me opportunities to coach and develop junior team members. My manager and skip-level see me as their go-to subject matter expert. I do not have any direct reports.\n\nThe role is great because of the autonomy I am given for business impact, in addition my established brand/visibility with my leadership team. However, I'm feeling stagnant in terms of developmental opportunities and there's no business need for another IC L+1 on this team (low likelihood of promo). \n\nI enjoy programmatic advertising and generally, the ad tech ecosystem - specifically, how the industry is fast-paced, heavily data-driven, and necessitates constant learning. I also am one of the most \"technical\" ICs on my team, with deep product knowledge on ad serving/delivery, and competent understanding of web technologies. I like the idea of becoming more technical in SQL/Python to enhance my data analysis tools as well.\n\nHowever, I am at a juncture in my career: do I invest more time in the partnerships ladder and become a manager, or explore something new like data engineering or product management? Again, I love data-driven decision making and in the AI era, data is the new oil. From a PM perspective, I feel like my programmatic experience has given me a unique perspective, allowing me to understand the relationship between tech, data, and user behavior.\n\nTo help frame what's next, I'd like to optimize for higher salary ceiling and learning opportunities.\n\nI would love advice from the experienced programmatic folks here who have successfully navigated their own careers or transitioned into a different role:\n\n1. How can I broaden my skill set beyond to enrich my career in programmatic? Are there specific skills  that I should be learning?\n2. Career Trajectory: Would love to hear success stories of people who have transitioned from partnership roles to other positions within technology companies? What skills, experiences, or attributes were pivotal in their career progression?\n\nI genuinely appreciate any guidance or insights you can offer. Your collective advice will hopefully help me make informed decisions about my professional journey.\n\nLooking forward to reading your responses, also very excited to continue this journey within the programmatic and tech realm, with a potential venture into a new career path!",

Most DSPs set minimums of $5K to $10K per month because they can’t profitably manage smaller budgets with full service. So you’re not doing anything wrong—that’s just how the industry operates. At **DurantaDev,** we make it easier for smaller brands and agencies to try programmatic and display advertising without a huge upfront spend. We group several brands under our managed account. That way, you still get access to quality inventory, effective targeting, and expert pacing, but you don’t have to worry about meeting those big minimums alone. If you’re doing local B2B efforts, like reaching out to business owners or executives in your city, we keep it simple and realistic. We use geo-targeting, some contextual layers, and retargeting to ensure your ads reach the right audience. No wasted spending, no complicated setup that’s hard to track. With a budget of around $1.5K to $3K a month over a few months, you’ll see what’s working and decide if it makes sense to scale up. Plus, you stay in control throughout the process. We pace the spend wisely, set clear daily caps, and provide transparent reports so you always know exactly where your money goes. If you’re interested, I’d be happy to share a quick example of how we’d set it up—including geo-targeting, audience, and expected reach. No pressure at all. Just let me know if you want to see it. Hope this helps! I love seeing brands test things out intelligently before going all in.   \n  \nCheers!",

I do all other activations/management, but that’s the focus.\n\nA lot of firms just hire out your programmatic and sign on the dotted line. They really don’t manage them or know what they are doing. “Ya we optimize for KPIs” while simultaneously having weak measurements or improperly set up pixels and floodlights. It’s sad. Same with pricing and fees, a lot of it isn’t transparent for the client at all. If i told them some of the fees agency’s just use their money for they would die. Looking at you managed TTD.\n\nGoing to hopefully grab attention with free consultations and go from there. Hoping to have my “stuff” up and running this week. \n\nIs there anything you all find lacking on your agencies side in terms of programmatic?

          "body": "This is a well-documented issue across the industry. Having worked with multiple NYC-based marketing agencies and dozens of professionals, it’s evident that programmatic advertising presents unique complexity challenges. There’s often a clear distinction between practitioners who are self-taught versus those who learned from experienced programmatic specialists. The most effective programmatic professionals typically build teams on the agency side before transitioning to consulting roles.\n\nKnowledge gaps emerge for several key reasons:\n\n1. Insufficient leadership development and knowledge transfer. When senior practitioners lack the time or capability to mentor analysts, institutional knowledge erodes. This creates a cycle where analysts advance to leadership positions without adequate foundational training, as recent graduates are left to self-educate.\n\n2. High industry turnover rates. The practice of changing agencies for 20% salary increases has historically been common, leading to talent migration before deep expertise can be fully developed. Top programmatic specialists often move to technology companies or consulting firms, further depleting agency knowledge bases.\n\n3. Limited practical learning opportunities. While theoretical training programs exist, programmatic expertise requires hands-on campaign building and optimization experience with substantial budgets. Managing campaigns at scale provides learning opportunities that smaller budget campaigns cannot replicate.\n\n4. Rapid technological evolution. The programmatic landscape changes continuously, with manual optimization techniques potentially becoming obsolete as platforms like DV360 deprecate certain features and demand-side platforms become increasingly automated, reducing the need for manual intervention.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nKnowledge gaps occur because incentives keep people moving firms and ultimately a lot of institutional knowledge gets lost.",

We don't use an ad server for third-party conversion verification, so I'm trying to align the conversion attribution as closely as possible between the two platforms. The settings look the exact same in each platform, however Basis' conversion count is MUCH higher than TTD, and conversions (viewthrough and clickthrough) are higher than regular clicks in Basis. Does anyone have advice on how to better align attribution here? Or have you seen conversions be much higher in Basis vs. TTD? Our lookback window, deduplication settings, and targeting is all the same. Thank you!!",

Turning off view-through measurement then basically will just be last-touch attribution, which we all know is highly flawed. I don’t think the conversion count in Basis is shady- I’d assume it’s just that users exposed to ads served via Basis ended up clicking on a TTD ad prior to conversion. \nI think the only way you do this is to run a 30-day test on each while the other DSP is dark?

      "content": "Hey Programmatic experts! Could use some advice or a pep talk on my future in programamtic/digital media. Things feel bleak.😑\n\nI'll start off with 3 years ago I completely changed careers to digital media. I've enjoyed it and dont regret the career change, but have been really unhappy at my job for over a year now. Our team mostly has self service clients (I truly dislike self service work, I want to be hands on keyboard really learning at this point not making recommendations and hoping for the best). We get a few short term managed service opportunities that I get to manage, but they are very infrequent. Also, many of these clients are in the platform checking everything we do so it doesnt really feel like a managed service model. When its been a client that didn't have a seat, its been fine and the few times a month client interaction was alright.\n\nIn order to move up on my team it would be like 4 client calls minimum a week on top of what I'm doing. When I started all we had were senior traders and 3 account managers so I took over tasks that really were for traders and account managers (basically anything from coordinator through 6 years of experience was free game while the team was built).\n\nWithout these client calls I can barely keep up and feel like I'm learning nothing but doing constant busy work lately. I feel like I have 0 future on this team and I'm feeling lost. I've been open and honest with my manager and above them but its either take this next role or you need to move teams (understandable). Ive tried moving teams but the past 3 jobs I've applied for at our company went outside the company, although I'd like to stay. I dislike being on the team because I feel like I dont belong and I dislike the future for me on the team and client calls for a couple hours every day in addition to consistent client emails (70 partners so our team gets bombarded) so it doesn't really feel like a promotion when I think about my future there.\n\nIve applied outside the company and cant even get an interview (some feedback was not enough hands on keyboard experience). Ive even applied for social and search positions but those are instant rejections (only exposed in my training). \n\nMy mental health is tanking, I really have very limited flexibility for a remote role given so much going on outside of work, I haven't gotten a promotion in almost 3 years after changing careers and taking a pay cut so  really not doing so well with $55k a year and spending more than 40 hours to get my job done with said paycut. \n\nIs there hope and is anyone working my dream job or hands on keyboard roles with limited to no client interaction?? Need advice on how to grow where you want and/or a peptalk.\n\n\nSorry for the book. 😬",

DV360 calls app/url lists “Channels” for some reason even though that’s a term used elsewhere, sigh. Example use case: you might want to save an inclusion list of CTV apps/urls separately from an inclusion list of display apps/sites. You create those lists here and then can apply the full lists to the applicable line items instead of having to upload the full list of individual apps/urls to every line. “Channels” aka site lists are for non-YouTube lines. The keyword section in resources is specifically for saving negative keyword lists (no clue why you can’t save lists for positive keyword targeting, but Google’s gonna Google)\n\nIn the advertiser level targeting section, you’ll see a section for channels and YouTube URLs - this is specifically for setting advertiser level “channel” exclusions ( a.k.a. non-YouTube app/url exclusion lists that are saved/managed from the resources section) and separately for YouTube, applying an exclusion list based on YouTube URLs. In either case, exclusions set at this level would apply to all line items within this advertiser. \n\nSimilar for the advertiser level keyword exclusions section - this is a top down application of keywords that you’d like to be excluded on all line items in the advertiser. For some reason the advertiser level keyword exclusions don’t let you pull from the saved keyword lists that you create in the resource section.",

I’m wondering if anyone has found ways to get more granular, either through DSPs, custom audience uploads, or other tools.\n\nOpen to hearing any experiences — especially interested in platforms that don’t require a hefty minimum spend or complicated managed services.

Currently work in an AdOps role as an AM on the Publisher side. \n\nCurious to see if anyone has similar experience as well as pros/cons of either. \n\nMy experience Publisher side has been great. I went Publisher side for more client facing experience and to get a big Employer name on my resume. Growth is my biggest motivation for change as the only direct movement within the AdOps department is in people management. Those roles are pretty cutthroat and usually 25-30 competing for a role that may open up once a year at best. \n\nThe DSP role is interesting because it is pretty data-driven, has the nice benefits, and seems to have more upward roles suited for individual contributors. The data aspect also seems to be a more versatile skill than say trafficking tags for example. In the case that this role does not pan out, my plan is to pursue inventory analytics or Research on the publisher side\n\nAny downsides to leaving publisher side? Curious to hear other experiences and any advice. Thank you in advance",

Anyone that claims Amazon DSP is not an objective likely has never managed a campaign in that platform. You can run any 3P deal ID in ADSP that you can run in TTD and they are rolling out a new suite of solutions to manage 3p publisher commitments in the UI seamlessly. \nTTD has a better offering today than Amazon, but that’s only because Amazon is still playing catch-up product-wise. TTD owns nothing and while they claim to objectivity, just ask anyone who works there about what OpenPath is and they will start stuttering. TTD is getting squeezed and will be likely laying people off in the next 6 months (recruiting efforts have been frozen on some teams recently)\n\nEmployee experience:\nLike most places so much of it depends on what team you are on/who you work for. From what I’ve heard Amazon Ads is very much a part of the overall Amazon corporate work culture (intense atmosphere, aggressive growth targets/goals, stack ranking employees etc.), but if you can stomach that and you are a high performer it can be a very rewarding experience. Both companies  pay well. With TTD there are now enough question-marks on TTDs value in an Agentic AI advertising world to make you wonder long-term how sustainable their dominance is.

          "body": "This is a very common and frustrating situation, and you've already identified the key potential culprits, which is great.\n\nThe large disparity between 980 DV360 clicks, 150 GA4 sessions, and 0 Floodlight conversions strongly points to a technical issue with the tag implementation or a major tracking limitation, much more so than just poor performance, although that can’t be ruled out entirely.\n\nThe first step in troubleshooting should be to confirm the Floodlight tag's firing status.\n\nSince you're using GTM, use the Google Tag Assistant in your browser's developer tools on the live landing page after simulating a click from DV360 (by including the `dclid` parameter in the URL) to see if the tag fires and, critically, what data it sends.\n\nCheck the network tab for a call to `fls.doubleclick.net` or `ad.doubleclick.net` with the correct `src=`, `type=`, and `cat=` values from your Floodlight activity.\n\nIf the tag *is* firing, look closely at the parameters.\n\nIf it's *not* firing, the issue is with your GTM trigger logic or the Floodlight tag setup in GTM itself.\n\nThe discrepancy between 980 clicks and 150 sessions is also a huge red flag that suggests either severe click fraud/bot traffic, users bouncing immediately before GA4/Floodlight can load, or the loss of tracking parameters like `dclid` during redirects, which would prevent the Floodlight from attributing the conversion even if it fired.\n\nThe fact that you see 150 sessions in GA4 but zero conversions in DV360 strongly supports your hypothesis that users aren't accepting cookies, as DV360's standard Floodlight tracking relies heavily on a third-party cookie (or first-party cookie set on the page if you have a Global Site Tag implementation) to connect the initial ad click to the final conversion event.\n\nModern browser restrictions like ITP are making client-side, cookie-based tracking increasingly unreliable.\n\nGiven the current privacy landscape and the issues you're facing, the combination of Google Ads Conversions API (CAPI - essentially the server-side solution for Google's ecosystem) with Google Tag Manager and Stape.io (or another Server-Side GTM hosting solution) is an excellent, future-proof approach to resolve this and improve tracking accuracy across all your campaigns, not just DV360.\n\nBy shifting your tracking from the user's browser (client-side) to a cloud server you control (server-side), this setup offers three major benefits: improved accuracy and data fidelity because you bypass many ad blockers and browser-based cookie restrictions like ITP and ETP which are likely causing your zero-conversion issue; greater control over the data you collect and send to advertising platforms, ensuring compliance and quality; and faster website performance because you load fewer third-party scripts on the user's browser, which helps with the bounce issue.\n\nYou can use this server-side setup to deploy your Floodlight tags, sending the conversion data directly to the server, where it's less likely to be blocked, leading to more complete and reliable reporting and better performance for your DV360 bidding strategies.",

One thing aggregators will do is put everything in FAST networks to increase their margin. If youre negotiating an aggressive CPM and that's what youre getting, totally fine. If youre paying a fairly high CPM (34-40) id be pressing to be on more premium networks. Ultimately they will say theyre following the audience which is partly true, but at that CPM you should be getting some Hulu, peacock etc.\n\nBut overall FAST networks I believe have gotten a bad name due to old school TV media buying philosophies. Media buyers who are used to buying cable would look at a report and be like \"look at this junk im on game show network, mtv2, fs2 etc\". With the assumption these are low viewed networks at off hours and nobody is watching. So people see these lesser known FAST networks and think similarly, not considering CTV is a 1to1. So while you pay more on cable to be on ESPN, that's because more people are likely to be watching. CTV gets served because a viewer has the TV on, whether its Tubi or Netflix. Now there's an argument to be made that the Netflix spot is more valuable because the user is paying for a subscription, so is more likely to be of higher quality. In addition, having your brand associated with Netflix and the high quality programs they put out is good for business. All thats true, but youre tending to pay an overinflated CPM for that while id argue FAST networks are undervalued.\n\nId just be mindful of the CPM your paying an aggregator if youre getting nothing but FAST networks.",

Terrible if you are actually trying to build and manage a full programmatic stack/plan. DV/TTD are tier one, they have literally anything you could want in DSP. Audio, display, video, CTV.

While I’m not fully soured on TTD like many, I want to at least vet other DSPs this year, either as a fail safe or as a parallel programmatic option.\n\nAmazon and Walmart DSPs, and the like, are heavy retail focused and walled (pun intended, but there are others like this, and while I understand Amazon can do a bit more for a brand/client in the eComm space, like access to Twitch and Prime video, it wasn’t enough for us to jump on board and operationalize another DSP). They also don’t offer a true replacement or safety net option if we wanted/needed to shift budget off TTD, to another full-stack DSP.\n\nSo, what are you favorite DSPs other than TTD/DV? StackAdapt? I won’t go to Centro/Basis. Has SurfSide come along enough or moved outside the cannabis niche? MediaMath? AdRoll? Adelphic? Personal anecdotes or preferences are welcome, beyond tangible, data/results-driven reasons for supporting a secondary DSP! \n\n",

At first I tried Google display ads (still trying tbh) but they are not targeted enough, I only can pick a location with 1 km radius, especially if the hospital is in a city, 1 km radius is way too big. \n\nThen I read about DSPs (i think I understand 10% of it, I come from meta ads, don’t know anything about DSP). Some of them offered precision geofencing, but not in Germany. Or others said the reach is too small if we try to geotarget 3 hospitals and that it won’t work. \n\nThe guys from targetoo told me the same, but still created an account for me and I started advertising. Unfortunately no application after 1 week. Not even a relevant click, it’s 200 clicks total but everyone jumps off the website immediately, so I think it’s bots or people who clicked accidentally.\n\nnow the part which frustrates me: there is another agency in Germany, who offers the exact same thing: geofencing hospitals to get healthcare-worker applications and it works. So I know there is a way to make it work, i just don’t know how. \n\nSorry for the long text. If someone has an idea, I would highly appreciate it.",
