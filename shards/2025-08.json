          "body": "I wouldn't say any platform is perfect for measurement anymore, especially when looking at attribution.\n\nUltimately for programmatic, everyone cares a bit more about the value of an impression or view alongside clicks, so certain tech caters to this / adds to their measurement with certain caveats.\n\nSo you have the following:\n\n* **Adservers** : to which you have pointed out CM360 & Innovid as the big 2 in this space, with Adform no.3. They have the ability to track both impressions & clicks to form attribution both last touch and DDA where supported. But often they have to also model to account for limitations in signals like 3P cookies. Innovid and the fTrack ID in particular has its pros / cons from legacy Flashtalking\n* **Site Analytics:** your typical site analytics solutions, the most popular being Google Analytics still followed by Adobe Analytics / CJA and then the more bespoke ones like Matomo / Mixpanel etc. These largely can only track click based interactions, albeit Google are bringing more impression data to GA and Adobe can do it on Adobe platforms only\n* **MMPs :** may be a weird callout, but I see this as the dark horse of measurement, especially if you are running dual app / web properties and want to see the omnichannel view. The SDK approach of app and the nuances of measurement with SKAdNetwork etc has meant these guys have had to solve measurement a lot more technically than web, so the Appsflyer / Adjust / Branch / Kochava of this world have done a good job with App measurement and then rolled out their pixel to try unify it with web / CTV\n* **1st Party \"MTA\":** this is fairly specific to certain verticals but primarily ecommerce that may sit on a Shopify / WooCommerce setup. The rise of certain 1st party MTA solutions like a TripleWhale / Hyros / Northbeam or even DoubleVerify acquiring Rockerbox, that suggest that they can do things that not even Walled Gardens themselves can do but in reality there are some smoke & mirrors going on\n* **Data Clean Rooms :** with where things like commerce / retail media is going and the concept of a DCR, there is for sure a role of this in holistic measurement. InfoSum / LiveRamp are the big 2 from a neutral perspective but Walled Gardens have their i.e. AMC for Amazon, ADH for Google & AA for Meta. For Amazon, if you are not using AMC as an endemic brand, you are now at a disadvantage imo\n\nPlenty of choices / views you can have from all of those, but really the best in class measurement is to tie that together with experimentation / lift / incrementality testing alongside a more macro econometrics / MMM view. Attribution is part of that \"triangulation\", but is the least trustworthy imo.",

The cost of *not* doing incrementality experiments, lift tests, maintaining hold outs, etc means you do not have a mathematically sound (read: statsig) basis from which to make your decisions. Which means all of your other investments leave you, in essence, spending a fuck ton of resources to effectively be guessing. \n\nAnd then you look at big picture things like MMM. They are critical to inform budgets, but require substantial investment and transformation to provide the necessary data, data quality, data consistency to detect changes (which often means always on campaigns), etc.\n\nSo in some ways, the tech stack is really like having a fancy sports car.

What's not being discussed is how major of a stumble this is relative to a major corporate event about to take place behind the scenes. \n\n5 years ago the clock was up on JG's stranglehold on the company and they needed to initiate a vote to extend the dual class share structure. Back then in summer 2020, the stock was lighting a fire like all tech companies, and everyone saw fit to let Jeff keep the wheel and re-examine the issue in five more years.\n\n  \nTimes up. \n\n  \nThe letter screenshot above went out to shareholders fairly recently. I don't know who from the C Suite on down thought it was a good idea to send this out with this language prior to Q2 earnings hitting the street but they were.......misguided at best. It glosses the Q4 speed bump with the assumption that all things are pointing up up up as we head into the vote being locked in September, but then yesterday happened and well.......this all screams red alert something ain't working.\n\nIn the five years since Jeff retained his total control of the company the stock is up as of today a whopping....20ish%. The S&P over the same time? ....93%\n\n  \nOver 4 years the stock is DOWN 26% while the SP is up over 40%. \n\nSince TTD started spending over $1B of investor money that could have been a 1 time dividend, is we assumed they had the best timing ever and bought at the lows they'd be up 20%, but if we assume the worst and say they bought at the peak they'd be down.......60%. Odds aren't strong they're up on that buyback right now that you could have put into the SP500 if they had just paid it out. \n\nSuffice to say: if you're not a TTD shareholder you might say so what who gives a fuck, Kokai still stinks worse than my dog's asshole. Well fair trader, keep an eye on this vote. Hard to say how its going to end up, I'm sure TTD Corp relations is on overdrive tossing blow and hookers at institutional investors to shore this up. But the numbers today paint a pretty clear picture that the last 5 years were not good by any measure, they're barely above stagnant when you realize inflation is about the same in those 5 years as TTDs stock growth. And if the vote doesn't go Jeff's way, he's going to have a new board of directors to answer to, and we'll see how that changes the companies strategies moving ahead. ",

In fact, they’ve hit 33/34 earnings, including a beat this quarter with 19% growth.  (Which far outweighs google growth.. especially their DSP which I believe was flat/down in their breakouts).   Jeff cannot control how the market reacts to earnings… in fact, I’d argue the market is fairly irrational and driven more by options these days than earnings.   For example, look at IAS.

Has programmatic truly helped your bottom line or would you go back to a more direct sales first approach if you could?",

Can I get view-through attribution by leveraging Google's offline conversion API or does that require gclids, making it click-through attribution only?\n\nAppreciate any help here, I'm a newb with DV360.",

That's a huge step and honestly the executive dysfunction in our field can be brutal without proper support.\n\n\n\nI actually went the opposite direction - was on Adderall for years but ended up quitting meds back in 2020 (still have the last prescription bottle sitting around lol). Not saying meds are bad at all, they just weren't sustainable for me long term.\n\n\n\nWhat I found was that programmatic work actually suits ADHD brains pretty well once you get systems in place. The data, the optimization, the constant pivoting - it's like our brains were made for it. But the executive function stuff... yeah that's the real killer.\n\n\n\nIf you're open to it, timeboxing saved my career. I plan every single day the night before and put everything on my calendar - not just meetings but actual work blocks. Sounds simple but it gives you that external structure your brain craves.\n\n\n\nAlso, duplicating everything helped me tons. Chargers in every room, backup headphones, etc. Removes so much friction when you're already fighting your brain to get started.\n\n\n\nThe meds will probably help a lot with focus, but don't sleep on building systems too. They work together really well and the systems stick around even if you ever decide to change your medication approach.\n\n\n\nHow are you finding the transition so far? The first few weeks can be pretty eye-opening.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.",

So when you pull reporting for media cost, the 15% should already be baked in that.

Took a pay cut to get a sales role in 2015, but it got me a foot in the door, and two years later was poached by a bigger DSP, by 2018 was a sales director (individual contributor).\n\nIn my experience (UK) it's a benefit, but ultimately you can learn a lot. I do wish I could see what other platforms look like (I am only really well versed in two major DSPs) so I think people with agency experience will have a leg up, but at the end of the day it is a sales role, so you need to have the sales mentality... ie be good at sales, you can learn any product/platform in a few month.",

Dun & Bradstreet has really good B2B targeting for job hunters and targeting job titles (for poaching). Bombora also has good B2B datasets.\n\n\n2) Endemic site placement. Are you able to secure inventory on job / industry related sites. Indeed, monster, adweek, adexchanger, etc. \n\n3) What’s your messaging? Condensing an entire job posting into a banner ad is no small feat. If you were looking for a new job, what messaging or keywords would you want to see in an ad that would drive you investigate further?\n\n\n4) Your attribution engine. How are you going to qualify success? If you place a pixel on the sites application pages, job posting pages, and submission confirmation, you should be able to measure what media channels are driving success here for optimizations. Depending on your programmatic partner, You can also create LALs or retarget based on specific page visitation. \n\nThese are my KPI reccos (in order): \n- Conversions / application submissions - based on View-Thru if you’re running programmatic. Last touch always favors google.\n\n- Reach against the audience. You need a strong reach to get measurable results.\n\n- clicks. Clicks are dumb. At best, CTR should be a tertiary metric.\n\n- VTR if running video. But I’d only look at VTR to ensure the inventory you’re getting is quality. ie, CTV VTR should never be less than 93%. If under 90% I’d assume they’re mixing OLV into their CTV inventory.\n\n\nIn all, I’ve seen this tactic used in healthcare, home services, tech, IT, etc. Those 4 bullets above are how I’ve structured the approach and then pivoted for industry nuances.",

When running programmatic, you will almost always see an increase in leads/site visits/etc from direct, organic, referral, and even paid channels when prog ads are running. This is from brand recall - seeing the brand frequently enough that once the need arises, they’re more likely to conduct an online search (paid or organic) or type the website directly into the search bar. \n\nIf they’re insistent on leads, I would recommend having some form of conversion action set up in platform to be able to measure against as platform conversions will track view through, whereas GA4 is only click through. If you’re tracking a form fill, implement a conversion action for it; maybe even another action for form starts or a click to call numbers. \n\nGoodluck!",

Slower ads tend to hurt CTR and conversions even if they look more “viewable” in the metrics.  \n  \n**Market snapshot (July 2025):**  \nDisplay CPMs ↓ 0.5% MoM | ↓ 27% YoY  \nVideo CPMs ↓ 6% MoM | ↓ 21% YoY  \nMobile CPMs ↑ 4% MoM, but Desktop ↓ 13% MoM  \nCTV CPMs stood out with +55% YoY growth  \n  \n**Takeaway:**  \nViewability ≠ effectiveness. Optimizing for user experience, load times, and placement quality is more critical than chasing “slow = visible” scenarios.  \n  \nThe full dataset and breakdown (MoM/YoY, device-level, integrations, etc.), the full July Programmatic Trends report is here: [**Click Here**](https://databeat.io/blog/us-programmatic-trends-july-2025/?utm_source=reddit&&utm_medium=organic_social&&utm_campaign=us+programmatic+trends+july+2025)  \n  \nCurious for those running programmatic at scale:  \n👉 Have you seen slower/heavier creative formats showing “better” viewability in your environments? How are you balancing that with user experience?",

Looking for some advice on creating a VAST tag for a client’s video ad placement. Here’s the scoop:\n\nOur client’s placing a video billboard ad on a third-party advertiser’s site, and they’ve required us to create a VAST tag. While I’ve never done this, I brushed up on the steps to do so. Looks like I need access to Google Ad Manager, but since we don’t have AdSense as an agency, looks like this isn’t a possibility. We don’t sell ad real estate, only run campaigns and purchase it.\n\nLooks like the VAST tag itself is an XML file with html-coded parameters in it. Is this something I could easily code by hand and export for the vendor? Or is there an even simpler solution I’m not considering? Any help is appreciated, and hoping to learn from this for future endeavors. Thanks in advance!",

I'm not saying it'll never happen, but usually if you're directly negotiating with a publisher, they're going to be more than willing to handle the creative hosting if you need it. I understand they have a cost that comes with ad serving (e.g., if you hosted the creative yourself in CM360, you'd pay a CPM fee somewhere around $0.25-$0.40 depending on your contract), but they should just be able to bake the cost of hosting your creative into your media buy.\n\nIf this is a quick-turn need, can you ask them if they could adjust the CPM to cover hosting the ad creative on your behalf? You'll get fewer impressions in total than what you agreed to up front, but that'll get the job done in a pinch. I can't imagine any publisher wouldn't be willing to work with you.",

Are any of you using the Prebid Mobile SDK these days, or do most of you stick with AppLovin, Unity, IronSource, etc? Curious what’s working best for indie devs right now.",

I'd say the best approach is to use a managed service that gives you some autonomy and allows maximum competition. I went through this for a casual gaming business recently.",

One of their per-employeement questionnaires was passed around (again) on Reddit and it is indeed totally devoid of relevant job questions and is indeed filled with really strange and vague questions that have no relevance to the job.\n\nThis is why I don't have a job at a big tech company. I have no idea what those weird questions are or how to answer them as they have absolutely nothing to do with the job I would be doing there. So, there's no point in even bothering throwing them a resume, because there's absolutely no way I can navigate that Machiavellian maze of total BS. So, there's no point...\n\nThey're clearly just creating a system where you're going to \"get one of the questions wrong\" so, they always have a technically valid reason to not employee you. It's totally one sided. It's actually impossible to answer the questions \"correctly,\" because the questions are worded in a way where they're so ambiguous, that there's no universally correct answer, because that's not how English works. It's like they're asking you subjective questions deterministically, giving you no valid range for an exclusively correct answer.\n\nSo, they don't care about my ability as a software architect, but it matters that I'm a Unix hater. Oh kay now... They couldn't put a bigger \"don't waste your time sign\" there if they tried. So, I have to hate an old OS that basically led to creation of the internet, because they don't like the licensing agreement? I can't actually work with people that are that totally dishonest.\n\nIf that's the culture of goons they cultivated over there, then it's for a sure a complete waste of my time. Obviously their products are filled with bugs and crapware. Obviously... It makes complete sense... They don't want the care bears that actually give a care and value what they're doing, they want the haters...",
