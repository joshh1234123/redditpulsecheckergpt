Go deep in that practice. Agency side is a great starting point for that. People tend to overlook hands-on experience, but it will help you in the long run as it shows when someone never piloted a campaign, nor ever step foot in a DSP environment. \n\n Then I suggest pivoting to a more client-facing programmatic media strategy / media planning role if that's interesting to you. The combination of both hands-on experience + strategy will serve you well to ramp up and build your career, whether its DSP/adtech, client or agency side. I made the switch from agency to freelance and that mix is working great for me, 5 years in now. \n\nHope that helps!",

I think some white-label Prebid or white-label SSP providers offer a convenient GUI for integrating third-party DSPs, or charge 0% commission for connecting new DSPs. Or maybe you already have full-time developers that need to be kept busy since they are paid anyway. In my understanding, 20–30 req/sec would not create a noticeable server load. Also, integration usually does not take much time if the protocol is compatible and there is Prebid compatibility. (In my sandbox I already run my own Prebid server, with a DSP connected on one side and a test site on the other)\n\nRegarding the $10–20K per month ad spend - I know ad networks for whom $1-3K per month is enough to get connected. But at the current stage I don’t need such a big spend. First, I want to stabilize the system and collect the first successful cases myself before charging anyone for it. So right now this is more like an internal tool for affiliate marketing, and I’m not in a rush. I don’t need to maintain a team of people, just my own time and around $100 for production servers. In the meantime, I will also be slowly customizing my own Prebid server, creating and connecting mobile apps. Maintaining apps is cheaper than maintaining websites, since they don’t require hosting.",

      "content": "Hi r/programmatic! \n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about what it takes to build a truly exceptional career in our industry and wanted to pose a question to this community. There are so many experienced people here from the buy-side, sell-side, ad tech, and everywhere in between, and I’m hoping to learn from your diverse perspectives.\n\nI've been working in the space for over 7 years, primarily on the sell-side. I feel like I have a strong handle on my role, but I'm driven to keep improving. Lately, I've been wondering what separates the people who are simply \"good\" at their jobs from the individuals who are in the absolute top 1% of the field.\n\nBeyond just \"working hard,\" what does that next level look like? I'm curious what this community thinks. For example:\n\n* **Technical Skills:** Is it purely deep mastery of platforms (a specific DSP/SSP, GAM, etc.), or is the differentiator broader technical expertise like SQL, Python, or data visualization for unique analysis?\n* **Soft Skills:** How much of it comes down to things like masterful negotiation, next-level client communication, or the ability to tell a compelling story with data to senior stakeholders?\n* **Strategic Thinking:** Is it an almost intuitive grasp of auction dynamics? A macro-level view of where the industry is headed and the ability to position for it? Or is it a deep understanding of a client's business that goes far beyond campaign metrics?\n* **Mindset:** Are there specific habits, frameworks for thinking, or learning processes that you've consistently seen in the top performers you've worked with?\n\nI'm not looking for a secret formula, just genuinely curious to hear different takes on this. Eager to read your thoughts and learn from the discussion!",

      "content": "Hi everyone\n\nI've been in the media buying side of things for a few years now, mostly focused on lower funnel performance with very tight and stressful targets (and with low budgets as well, max 20k a month), yet somehow I find it fun (I might be crazy), but not long ago I joined a somewhat \"large\" agency to its programmatic team and to be honest I see some things very off to me, but they seem to be \"normal\" when talking with colleagues and reading this subreddit. So I wanted to ask everyone here directly.\n\n1) How is it possible that large advertisers throw up hundreds of thousands of dolars to programmtic for the sake of reach and CTR? It seems like as long as you match the media plan targets you are a fucker and did your job. Excuse me? How do these companies don't even try to \"tie\" somehow this wasted ad spend to some measurable results? \n\nComing from a performance background I actually applied some of my old book techniques and results in the current campaigns I manage increased dramatically and everyone around seemed surprised in the agency.\n\n2) Is it normal for programmatic to just worry about CTR or am I missing something? Because what I see is that all budget coming to programmatic is just wasted with no real outcome, but somehow this is normal and everyone keeps pouring money into it??\n\n3) When it comes to campaign performance, the best optimizations by far are tweaks/changes on the actual landing pages (at least according to my exp) but here nothing of this is done and its like \"wtf, just change this or that and results will dramatically improve\". How is it that normal to just work on the campaigns in platform? That's just \"distributing\" the message, not driving real actions, those are managed if the UX in the landing page is well done.\n\n4) Why is it that programmatic is constantly focused on awareness? I get it's a top channel for that but why nobody tries to do performance (real performance) as well? Even if it cannot compete as well with social or search ads?\n\nWhen in calls with clients/colleagues it's widely accepted that in programmatic we just need to focus on spending the money and have the expected reach, cpm and CTR. And that's all to it. Like, WTF? I do believe in programmatic we can do way more than just being \"those guys that do nothing\" and to be honest it feels incredibly frustrating. \n\nThing is that when talking with way more experienced colleagues than me in programmatic I see they lack many notions to very basic performance/business logics but it doesn't bother them and bosses are happy, clients somehow are happy and everything seems to hold in this apparent fragile equilibrium.\n\nIs any of this normal? What am I missing? Is that really all to it? Again, it's a large company that manages millions in advertising budgets, but they always attribute all client revenue exclusively to social ads or search, while in programmatic we are just \"there\" spending and \"raising awareness\".\n\nOverall I feel very confused right now and not sure if I want to keep working in programmatic because of this. What am I missing? Can you people share your thoughts on this? Am I the only one? I'd really like to understand.\n\nThanks if you read everything, I needed to get this out of my chest.",

          "body": "I used to also think that you’d should tie a campaign to a performance goal like sales, cpa, etc but the truth of the matter is that the vast majority of people don’t actually interact with ads and programmatic is really good at targeting a bunch of people that may or may not have been exposed to your brand before.  Theres also a boatload of advertisers where their website sales mean nothing compared to in-store sales at retailers.\n\nIt is kinda crazy that CTR is the key benchmark but that’s how agencies sell it. Non marketing executives also understand a click metric. But in reality, it’s hard to quantify programmatic display from a performance standpoint compared to search and social. Viewthrough conversions aren’t tracked in analytics platforms like GA4 or Shopify so relying on just DSP conversion data as the source of truth really doesn’t mean much because it takes credit for all conversions that a display ad touch without any consideration for other channel touch points. Back in the day like 5ish years ago it was a lot easier to track path to conversion across channels so you could see how programmatic played a role in the conversion path but with cookieless/walled gardens/iphone privacy in the past few years this has made it more difficult to do. \n\nUltimately people need to know about your brand before considering so focusing on just performance with programmatic will limit your overall reach. It’s more important to reach the target audience at a decent frequency so that they actually have brand recall.",

For the smaller businesses, every marketing dollar is scrutinized and investigated to help the business grow. When working in programmatic for large multinational corporations, programmatic and digital marketing budgets are just a small responsibility of a marketing director's job. In the end, they want to retain their budgets every year which is why they emphasize spending in full so procurement/finance let's them keep the same budgets. As to why not everything is tied to outcomes, it's partially because they have dedicated performance budgets or because a large part of their view on marketing is that it's about awareness and brand building.\n\nNeither of the two approaches is necessarily wrong, but the way you execute and understanding how people perceive your brand should be key. All you need to do to see a real life example of this is Nike's failed shift from brand focused advertising to a full performance brand, which they're now heavily back pedalling on. They've probably figured out that in the end performance marketing isn't the main driver of their growth and focusing too much of their marketing spend in that direction has averse affects on their brand image.",

That confirms which channels delivered and at what scale. 3) Path to Conversion: include Touchpoint Position and Inventory Type to see sequences; add Conversion Details to see final-touch channel. 4) Optional sanity checks: Reach & Frequency by Inventory Type to verify dedupe; label lines by channel for cleaner slicing. Also align attribution windows and confirm your universal pixel + events are on advertiser level.\n\nFor cross-checking, I’ve used GA4 and Adobe Analytics for intake, but HeatMap helped tie on-site click patterns to revenue when validating TTD’s channel mix.\n\nNet: use Inventory Type + deduped reach and PTC to prove multichannel in TTD.",

Is it creative costs, targeting, measurement, or just getting started?\n\n\t•\tMid-Market advertisers – For those spending around $250k range annually on ads, what challenges do you face with CTV? (e.g., proving ROAS, signal loss, fragmented reporting, limited tools built for mid-sized budgets, etc.)\n\n\t•\tEnterprise brands – For larger advertisers with big budgets, what are the blockers to scaling CTV as a performance channel? (e.g., attribution gaps, cross-screen measurement, walled garden dependency, cost efficiency, etc.)\n\n💰 As a quick benchmark: if you’re comfortable sharing, how much are you typically spending on CTV per year?\n\nThe goal here isn’t to pitch anything, but to collect insights from real practitioners so I can understand where Performance CTV delivers today and where it falls short.\n\nWould really appreciate your thoughts — even a couple of sentences on your biggest frustration would help a lot!\n\nThanks in advance 🙏\n",

Do they have a voice at the table in terms of allocation? Do they get to share their take on platforms? \n\nPlease note: this is not to devalue or denigrate their hard work. Speaking for myself god knows I would be up shits creek without the teams inputting campaigns and monitoring delivery and performance. I value all of them. But my leadership hardly knows their names and doesn’t blink when they leave the agency for another job as they know we’ll find the next entry level replacement. \n\nI find it insanely odd that TTD puts their traders forward in marketing materials like this. It seems totally disconnected from the reality of what I’ve seen at multiple agencies and across multiple teams at those agencies. \n\nIn any case, from one manager to all the HOKs out there, your work matters, we can’t do this without you, but it looks like if you want an existence akin to a Hindu cow TTD is your best bet because I don’t see that anywhere else.

I’d say campaigns I ran really well are the ones where the messaging is contextually relevant to the ad, for example a travel brand leveraging weather triggers. If you’re also buying other channels in an omni-channel DSP, OOH is a great way to drive depth and capture more market share based on which zip codes are driving performance on digital channels. Retargeting is also a great tactic, due to as someone mentioned before, receptivity for OOH is higher than TV or Digital and we use OOH to warm up consumers for higher engagement on lower funnel tactics. We’ve seen much shorter conversion windows based on reporting from TTD when OOH is in the path to conversion.\n\nIn terms of measurement, there’s been significant growth in the industry in the last 5 years or so. You can set up pixels on your landing/conversion pages and match deviceIDs of those exposed to OOH for attribution. I’d also recommend including OOH into your MMMs, and geo-lift incrementality tests. \n\nOverall, it isn’t fair to say OOH isn’t measurable and it’s just an awareness play. Tons of research and data out there shows that it’s an effective performance channel in a space that isn’t as saturated as what we’re seeing on CTV, digital and social.",

Where it does shine, however, is when you supplement it with your online campaigns. You’re exposing people online, for example, and then they also get your brand when they’re out walking around and seeing the big screen — the repeat exposure helps a lot for recall.\n\nIn terms of formats, I’ve seen transit screens, large-format billboards, and store DOOH do very well for awareness.

You should message exposed user segments with sequential calls to action via display/video/CTV retargeting to drive them further down the funnel, (esp if attempting more of a direct response strategy seeking to drive lower funnel conversions). \n\nDOOH as a standalone tactic is prob not the best way to spend your clients’ budget if it’s small and only provides enough media buying power for a singular channel campaign. But if part of a multi-channel programmatic strategy, it makes a lot of sense as it’s less-intrusive, it’s “breaking a mold” or it’s “different” than other programmatic formats (not only in terms of look and feel, but certainly in terms of planning, etc) and it allows for logical QR code scanning and different types of interaction.\n\nI recommend getting in touch with a Vistar or Place Exchange rep and having them talk through their methodology, planning/forecasting tools, venue/screen types, etc and go from there.",

It's also useful in niche scenarios(like marijuana campaigns) where google's restrictions won't let you run.\n\nTheir page context AI feature is cool - better than the keyword targeting on Google, and their team will build cool creatives for you if you spend enough. They'll even run campaigns for you if you're over something like $30K/quarter, so if your team is lean and needs some extra support, that's awesome.\n\n  \nThe major drawbacks are that you don't know how much your fees actually are(your AM won't even know this unless they know how to decipher some numbers on the back end-  but they don't receive that training), and they basically lie to you about what you're paying for (Ie - telling you all the data is free, when they're really just lumping the media and data costs together).\n\n  \nIf you're running your own ads and don't have enough money to go DV360, then Stackadapt can be useful - especially if you get into that range where they're running your campaigns for you, and your company doesn't need to hire people to do it.\n\nIf you've got the money to go with DV360, odds are your performance will be better. If your agency is using Stackadapt over DV360/Amazon/TTD, then you should be worried, because you're paying whatever your agency's markup is + stack's markup, which can be even higher than your agency's... and the agency might just be passing off the work to stack anyways, and just taking the cut.",

So now I need to create a third-party tag and place that link into that tag so that everything would work great (the banner is visible, it clicks through, and clicks and viewability would be counted). \n\nI tried to solve it with ChatGPT, which provided me with a tag, and when trying it out in DV360, it seemed to work nicely. However, when looking at the stats afterwards, I see that viewability is just a bit over 0% and I get traffic from weird non-standard domains. About that problem, ChatGPT said:\n\n*\"🔹 Why your iframe script failed*\n\n* *Your tag is just “dumb JS” that injects an iframe.*\n* *It does* ***not declare any DV360 macros*** *(other than ${CLICK\\_URL} in the iframe URL).*\n* *Because of that, DV360:*\n   * *Can’t correctly map impressions/clicks to placement.*\n   * *Can’t track viewability (there’s no DV360 signal layer inside the iframe).*\n   * *Ends up serving on low-quality / “remnant” inventory → hence the weird domains & near-zero viewability.*\n\n*Basically: DV360 treated it as an unverified 3rd-party iframe, not a proper creative with tracking hooks.\"*\n\n  \nHowever, ChatGPT doesn't really give me a working script. Maybe someone has had a similar problem and knows how to solve it?\n\n\\---\n\nThe script I used was:\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> (function() { var creative = document.createElement('iframe'); creative.src = \"https://www.testbanner.com/?click=${CLICK\\_URL}\"; creative.width = \"300\"; // set your banner width creative.height = \"250\"; // set your banner height creative.frameBorder = \"0\"; creative.scrolling = \"no\"; creative.marginHeight = \"0\"; creative.marginWidth = \"0\"; document.body.appendChild(creative); })(); </script>",

We’ve been running DV360 programmatic display ads through an agency for a while now, but the results have been pretty disappointing with almost no conversions. I’m starting to think it might make sense to test Google Ads display campaigns instead, since I feel like the GDN could actually perform better in terms of driving conversions.\n\nFor those of you who’ve worked with both, how different is the inventory and performance between DV360 and Google Ads display? Is DV360 really that much more effective, or does GDN cover most of what matters anyway?\n\nThis is for an online casino brand, so I know performance can be tricky, but I’d love to hear your general take.",

If your attribution is quite standard, it is very unlikely you will ever see it outperform those 2 channels, regardless of whether it is DV360 or Google Ads\n* If you are running Search via Google, are you using PMAX / Demand Gen? Granted both are blackboxes with plenty of grey areas but the overlap from a display inventory specifically is likely overlapping with your programmatic activity\n* As others have said, Google is much more stricter with gambling. Historically this is where a MediaMath / Xandr would mop up a lot of the gambling advertiser marketplace for programmatic. But to run a DSP correctly in a sensitive vertical is not that straight forward\n* What exactly is your measurement / attribution model? If it is last click then you are already on the back foot to prove any value of programmatic.

It could also be worth testing video ads, which often perform better than static display.\n\nEdited to say that it's also important to check that your attribution model isn't last click.",

When I initially did DV360 a lot of ads played on Tubi TV or Pluto TV like free viewing apps which I didnt like.\n\n**Does Slack Adapt have more options** to choose from vs DV360 & Amazon?\n\nIf you were me and **wanted to reach premium apps only** is there an alternative to DV360 or Amazon that you think would get me a good reach at a lower CPM, right now in DV360 im at like $25 CPM for quality apps and Amazon Private Auction im at $30.\n\nI was curious about Tatari as I saw an Ad on SharkTank, from Mr Wonderful, however i think its like $5k a week \"minimum\" required spend and the cheaper option they offer is less but is only CTV re-targeting vs linear.\n\n**Thanks for your feedback,** maybe this helps others like me know from others in the field what your take is and help guide us all.",

          "body": "StackAdapt doesn't have any of its own inventory. It's just a DSP that taps into other inventory providers. DV360 will probably give you the most reach simply because it allows you to buy YouTube inventory, which is the biggest video service on the planet.\n\nAs a small business, you don't have a reach problem from my perspective. You'll likely never be able to spend enough money to penetrate the full market with your budgets, so you need to find ways to make more impact with less money. To your point, playing most of your ads on Tubi or Pluto might not be the best strategy, albeit people *do* watch these services, so I think you need to refine your buying strategy rather than rethink your DSP. DV360 and Amazon DSP might be too full-featured for what you're looking for since they're primarily designed for enterprise-level customers with bigger budgets. It's good that people have mentioned your ads when you were using DV360/Amazon in the past, so maybe you just found out YouTube is not the best way to engage people.\n\nIt's hard to make a full recommendation without more budget details and background info on your business, but you could honestly consider something simple like Universal Ads (Comcast/NBCU's self-serve ad platform that taps directly into their inventory) or Disney Campaign Manager (direct access to Disney+, Hulu, ESPN). Those platforms are more lacking in terms of targeting and whatnot, but they're also designed for SMBs and offer comparatively low CPMs. Universal Ads doesn't really have much targeting beyond genre targeting now, but you could get into some solid CTV inventory for like $8-10 CPMs, which could be effective if you're just trying to promote a brick-and-mortar location in a very defined geographic area. Disney Campaign Manager has more targeting options, but the CPMs are higher because the inventory is usually more competitive.\n\nEither way, I don't think you should be looking to add yet another DSP to your mix, and I don't think you need to turn to something like Tatari or MNTN because those are sus in my opinion anyway. If you're truly a smaller business, you could do well with Universal Ads or Disney Campaign Manager, or you could simply refine your buying strategies on Amazon and DV360.",

If you're a Google Partner or book through an agency (and if you have a DV360 seat, I’d assume that’s the case), YouTube is basically the same between Google Ads and DV360. Sometimes certain beta and alpha tests are limited to either DV or Google Ads (many of them only to Google Ads).\n\nOn both platforms you have access to:\n\n- Programmatic guaranteed through Instant Reserve and YouTube Select. All fully self-bookable.\n- Demand Gen as the mid-funnel option\n- All automated and combined format strategies like Video Reach, Video View and other mixed-format campaigns\n- Different types of bidding, usually fully dependent on the format (CPM, CPV, CPA/ROAS with Demand Gen)\n- 20s, 30s and 60s Non-Skippables\n- Brand Lift studies\n- Cross-Media Reach Reports incl. TV\n- Third-party measurement through certified partners (like Nielsen & IAS)\n\nDV only:\n- Frequency cap across all inventory within your dv  campaign (a huge plus if you’re also running PA/PD deals across a lot of other video inventory)\n- cross media reach reports including other video inventory\n- if needed: it's a tad easier to automate unique reach reporting, as this is not available in the Google Ads Api and only within the UI\n- Con: additional DV fee\n\nFor many features, you need your Google Account Rep to whitelist your account. That applies to both Google Ads and DV360.\n\nIMHO, in DV, since YouTube is set up very differently from all other DV IO/LI, it’s basically just a Google Ads container in the backend hosting the campaign. Insertion Order settings don’t affect YouTube, and you must configure basically everything within the line item.\n\nDepending on your workflow, tech stack and client, both platforms are valid choices. You really don’t miss much in either one.\n\nSmall side note: it's Google Ads now. AdWords hasn't existed since 2018.",

And then there are cases where it really pushes CPMs higher.\n\nFrom my own experience in ad ops I’ve seen all of these work, depending on how the setup is done.\n\nSo I’m wondering, what’s “reward” for you. Side income, content strategy or a serious CPM booster? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. ",

As a result, many advertisers do not regularly use third-party data, and those that do typically invest nearly 20% of their media costs on it.\"",
