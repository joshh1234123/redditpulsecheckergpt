          "body": "Well they also own Amazon Prime Music which takes up another piece of the OTT stack, so now they’ve got 2 of the biggest under their umbrella, and one of which costs them very little outside of the fraction of royalties they’d be paying out to ascap and bmi that they also have a shit ton of purchase data on as well… so now they’ve can also more than likely identify a segment of user behavior on yet another app. It’s  honestly a solid move especially considering that they can essentially put a stranglehold on certain markets through music, podcast, and become even bigger in the audio book space. Now they’ve got a huge grip on all audio streaming, and let’s not forget about how many people use their devices in-home that are connected to both prime music and Spotify. This will enable them to connect even more cross device identification. \n\nNext they’ll partner with Live Nation and give them programmatic guarantees on the largest audio streaming app and their own in-house streaming app which is basically just part of the sales pitch they’ll throw their way. It doesn’t really matter how many people use amazon music. They’ve got the biggest audio streaming service in their pocket now, and they already crush the fucking audio book game. This is actually a huge partnership for them.",

They can now leverage Spotify’s wealth of music streamers and attach device id’s and map the biggest music streaming service’s users to their inferior music platform and all the other datapoints they have between device side data and pharmaceuticals (which they’re about to crush which also comes with insurance data), to e-commerce, to food/Whole Foods data, to streaming video, to you fucking name it dude. Mapping that number of additional accounts via Spotify and listener history lets the. Paint a whole other level of a buyer persona when paired with the wealth of data they already have on pretty much everyone. They just bridged a huge data gap and no one even recognizes it. If you think Live Nation isn’t trying to get in bed with Amazon after this move they certainly will. Record and merch sales through third party outlets is something they could never touch before but now through the Amazon dsp these segments will definitely be available as PGs.",

He's promising October announcements about innovations designed to improve the digital ad ecosystem for buy-side clients.\n\n**The context:** Trade Desk reports Q3 earnings in early November. Two narratives have been dogging the company: the open web is in decline, and TTD is losing ground. Green's positioning AI as the answer to both problems.\n\n**The actual announcements:** TTD is rolling out two new AI-powered features. First is a[ tool ](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250929471947/en/The-Trade-Desk-Announces-Major-Overhaul-of-Digital-Advertising-Data-Marketplace?utm_source=beehiiv&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=u-of-digital-newsletter-10-1-25-premium&_bhlid=b7dca467d992e70868dd73a495e673d0e5d370fa)that uses machine learning to evaluate and rank audience segments across hundreds of data vendors, replacing their current pay-per-provider model with simplified pricing that could cut data costs (which currently eat up nearly a fifth of media budgets). Second is new trading modes (Koa Adaptive Trading Modes) that let buyers choose between fully automated AI optimization(called Performance Mode) or hands-on(called Control Mode) campaign management with manual bidding and allocation controls. Both launch with select agencies later this year, then wider rollout early 2026.\n\n**The pitch:** These AI innovations will \"accelerate the inevitable long-term movement toward a transparent and efficient marketplace for digital ads.\"\n\nEither this is a legitimate shift in how programmatic buying works, or it's a well-timed product launch to reshape the conversation before earnings.\n\nWe'll know more in November.",

      "content": "Integral Ad Science (IAS) is being acquired by private equity firm Novacap for $1.9 billion, taking the company private just four years after its 2021 IPO.\n\n**The deal:**\n\n* Canadian PE firm Novacap buying IAS at $10.30/share (22% premium)\n* Vista Equity Partners (majority owner since 2018) exiting completely\n* Expected to close later this year, pending regulatory approval\n\n  \n**Why this matters:**\n\nIAS and DoubleVerify basically run ad verification as a duopoly. They've already captured most of the market, but there's a massive problem: nowhere left to grow.\n\nMarketers see verification as a necessary evil and a necessary tax, not something they want to spend more on. IAS's attempts to expand into ad serving and attribution haven't moved the needle. Big platforms are building their own brand safety tools in-house, eating into market share.\n\n**The real threat: Scope3**\n\nWhile IAS dealt with Adalytics reports and government scrutiny this year, AI-first startup Scope3 has been rebuilding verification from the ground up. Founder Brian O'Kelley (former AppNexus CEO) literally posted on LinkedIn about why IAS is going private: to compete with him.\n\nHis take: Going private gives you breathing room to rebuild without quarterly earnings calls, but it's not enough. You still need to invest heavily in R&D, embrace AI/agents, and move fast. If customers start asking, \"Do I need this if I have AI?\" and your answer isn't compelling, private equity won't save you.\n\n**The bigger picture:**\n\nThis is the beginning of a pattern. Legacy adtech built on rules-based systems is entering adapt-or-die mode. AI-native competitors that are lightweight and dynamic are the future.\n\nAd verification is just the start. Which other \"mature\" adtech sectors (DSPs, SSPs, DMPs) will see this same story play out in the next 2-3 years?\n\n**My take:**   \nGoing private buys IAS time to gut the product, rebuild around AI, and make risky bets without Wall Street breathing down its neck. Expect major changes in the next 18-24 months. The question is whether it'll be enough.\n\nWhat do you think? Can legacy adtech companies successfully reinvent themselves? ",

They could solve the TID issue for premium publishers tomorrow with one simple little UI tweak that has been possible for years (like at least the last 6+) yet they have hidden in the API never to let it see the light of day: Volume Control. Volume control essentially makes the DSP prioritize specific attributes for bid submission over others. They made a half ass version of it for Commitments, but the raw API version is a game changer in buying logic. It allows to you tier your supply properties even within a PMP to ensure you focus dollars/bids exactly where you want them. Want to make sure as much of your budget goes to vendors wit a TID? Volume control setting at 2 and drop all others to -1. You’ll only bid on the non TID supply when you absolutely have to to maintain pacing. \n\nWhy is TTD not making this simple UI tweak? Because TID isn’t about buyer transparency it’s about maintaining data infrastructure cost for TTD in their aging tech stack. If a pub sends 20x bid requests for the same impression that’s 20x the cost TTD needs to crunch in the exchange and store in post exchange processing that they don’t want eating into their margins. \n\nInstead of giving clients a simple and easy solution to force sellers to align to the buyers wants, they are convoluting the entire programmatic market with this mini-garden effort to shave 1% off their effective margin which they think keeps Wall Street happy, but somehow are ignoring that fact Wall St is plainly over TTD with the cuts analyst have given the company across the board. Wall Street analysts don’t care about this crap or Ventura OS, they want pure growth plain and simple. TTD is showing Wall St yet again its leadership is easily distracted by stupid esoteric fights instead of dealing with the increasing encroachment of Amazon. What a joke",

Ex: [Travel](https://premion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PREMION-Why-CTV-OTT-for-Travel-Tourism.pdf). \n\nMy biggest issue with them is they are not trying to listen and setup a campaign for success, they are setting it up for their Ad Ops efficiency. This is especially true if you are running other channels thru your own house or thru other partners. An example of this would be you ask to run sports, they hear that and say SURE! Then your running on re-runs of games on Pluto (when you wanted NFL). Yes it's what you asked for, but they don't clarify or ask questions.  \n\nYou can make it work with them if the price is right, but be sure to ask for things like:\n\n* Hours (only 6am - 10pm) or whatever works for you.  \n* Full list of APPs they can run on (it will be limited) IE you want Paramount+ they may not be able to get you that. BUT they will have the Paramount logo on their presentations b/c their getting that inventory thru Pluto OR Fubo. \n   * Issue with them is their a corporation, most of the time they are not trying to go outside their own bubble of inventory. \n   * They probably are not going to setup custom campaigns for you either if they can't support it or they don't have the scale for it. \n* What networks / content / devices / apps you don't want to go on.\n* SETUP a KPI, If you can get them to place a pixel on whatever your tracking. \n* What audiences can they work with? 1st Party, 3rd party etc. Can they do Retargeting? \n   * Can they match the audiences you are using on other channels? \n   * Ask to the see the segments they are using IE they could be using [Mosaic Audiences ](https://assets.cengage.com/gale/help/dnow/DataMethodology/MosaicUSA_Handbook.pdf)when you wanted to target HH with $150k + & 2 kids.\n\nIn my experience they have some cool tools like the Arrivalist that you might not be able to get thru anyone else at a $10k budget. BUT you have to force them to give you what you want alot of the time. They are not going to be setting you up for success unless you walk them thru the process. \n\nFeel free to pull the plug if they bait and switch you. It's your biggest superpower.   \nHope that helps.",

My sense is their CTV/OTT inventory isn’t hugely different from other SSPs- it looks to be less. The real question is whether you want to manage another UI just for CTV, or if you’d rather stick with an omnichannel solution that covers everything. Quite frankly you can get similar results with other non CTV focused companies. \n\nIf I were digging into them, I’d ask stuff like:\n\n\\- Are there any exclusive partnerships or inventory that actually set you apart?\n\n\\- Other vendors often struggle to scale DMA or zipcode targeting. How do you solve that where others can’t?\n\n\\- How transparent is your reporting? Can you see exactly which show and spot the ad ran on?\n\nDM me if you want to provide more info.",

In short: we have code on publishers sites that handles the referral and transactions for the mentioned retailers - code on page 1st party audiences.\n\nIm considering positioning the deals with the audience data at no additional cost to help build the market, but am curious to hear the perspective from agencies, brands and buyers on the value here.\n\nWe know from market research there are reasonably high minimums for similar data via TTD, Walmart and other RMN’s, my question is are we barking up the right tree with positioning and pricing?",

We’ve had around 7 impression conversions in StackAdapt, and can match 5 of them to real form fills — but 1–2 are missing, which is making the client question the tracking. Another thing that is happening is they are showing a UTM reference to StackAdapt on a particular date but we're not seeing it in StackAdapt.\n\nIt feels like there will always be some slight discrepancy in attribution models, but I’d love to hear how others explain this or validate the data with clients.

Sat through the demos, got the rep assigned, whole nine yards.\n\nFirst thing I noticed - it's literally TTD. Like the interface is TTD, the documentation is ttd, even the fucking URL structure is TTD. which cool, at least I'm not learning a completely new platform.\n\nThe audience targeting based on actual purchase behavior is legit. We can see what someone bought at Walmart and target them accordingly. The closed-loop attribution shows real incremental lift, not the usual \"last click gets all the credit\" bullshit.\n\nTrying to compare performance against our other TTD campaigns though? nightmare. The reporting doesn't quite line up. Walmart Connect has its own dashboard that shows retail-specific metrics but then you've got your TTD dashboard showing different numbers. reconciling what happened in-store vs online vs offsite is just spreadsheet hell.\n\nAlso the account management is completely separate from TTD. Different reps, different SLAs, different response times. same tech stack but you're managing two completely different relationships.\n\noh and if your client does business with Walmart already? Good fucking luck separating out the retail media performance from everything else they've got going on with them. their sales team doesn't talk to the Connect team apparently.\n\nWas it worth it? Yeah honestly, the attribution alone justifies it if you've got clients selling through Walmart. but anyone telling you it's seamless because it's TTD under the hood is full of shit.\n\nAnyone else running Walmart Connect alongside regular TTD? how are you handling the reporting situation?",

The publisher negotiated a direct revshare w TTD (May not always be the case but it wouldn’t be atypical to say “integrate direct and we charge lower revshare than an ssp”)\n2. Has to agree to White Ops fraud tracking (like every other SSP/Pub)\n3. TTD (likely?) makes a revshare off of on the back end (can’t confirm this but it’s usually how any data economics model goes?) and \n4. The Pub signal largely feeds into their graph which makes the graph better, and thereby\n5. They charge a CPM for (Value exchange)\n\nIt’s shifting where they recuperate revenue due to lower eCPMs of direct supply pathing, in turn for creating a distinct product. \n\nYes in the grand scheme of things it results in fewer hops, better identity, match rates etc but those economics and benefits are balanced w the fees and costs faced elsewhere so important people always look at bigger picture. Is there a net positive effect?  Likely yes - every new product and feature has a cost, that may just be recuperated elsewhere and by someone else. \n\nEverything has a pro and a con.

It's a work I enjoy and have fun with (but not to be underpaid, or at least its how I feel like) and why not saying it, I'm good at.\n\nMy questions for you, how do you see currently the job market on the programmatic end in europe? What salaries in northern/nordics countries are average for somebody of my experience on average? Any advice or tips when doing this job switch? I'd like to still work in programmatic, but again, I have experience on full funnel media buying.\n\nI dont mind at all taking more responsibilities, I just want to get properly paid for it.\n\nJust another guy trying to make his way in the galaxy as Jango Fett would say.\n\nThanks everyone, if you have questions for me or need more context, I'll happy provide.

      "content": "Been digging into some ads.txt data from October and noticed a few shifts that might be worth discussing.\n\nAcross roughly 50k US publisher domains, there was a net gain of about 29k ads.txt lines - slower than last month but still positive. What stood out is that mid-traffic publishers (ranks 501–2000) contributed the most to that growth, adding around 14.8k new lines.\n\nOn the SSP side:\n\n* **Unruly** and Connatix saw the strongest uptick in new direct entries.\n* **Blis, TrustedStack, MobileFuse,** and **SCREENCORE** all climbed in rank among scaling and emerging players.\n* Larger “established” SSPs seem to be hitting some duplication issues - showing up both as direct and reseller connections on the same domains, which could be causing unnecessary auction overlap.\n\nSeems like the market is slowly shifting away from purely high-traffic publisher focus and into more mid/long-tail partnerships. Curious if others here are seeing similar patterns in your own data or platform side?\n\nFull dataset and breakdown are up here if anyone wants to look at the numbers: [Click here](https://databeat.io/blog/sellers-report-october-2025/?utm_source=reddit&&utm_medium=organic_social&&utm_campaign=sellers+report+october+2025)",

So what does the ecosystem look like under those conditions, and who best to work for?\n\nPublishers will still exist, with much less traffic, and therefore much fewer staff. Subscriptions will be more prevalent than they are now, and most traffic (for large publishers) will be allocated to direct sales because of the higher yield. In other words, programmatic will take the hit. More publishers will outsource programmatic to the large aggregators in order to tie cost to revenue, but those networks will still see overall traffic declines and shrink themselves.\n\nWith less publisher traffic, SSPs and DSPs and all the middleware take the hit and also contract. Margins and volume decrease. This also affects retail media because there are fewer retargeting opportunities, CTV may be ok but the demand isn't there for many channels.

I work in the igaming industry, mostly with mobile casino apps, so good reporting is everything.\n\nI’ve managed to build a system that connects all my DSPs like Moloco, Mintegral, and Unity through custom MCPs I created myself, basically small API connectors that let my AI agents access campaign data directly. Then I use Claude Code to run personalized agents for each DSP. Each one can fetch the data it needs, combine it with real user data from AppsFlyer, and mix it with internal app metrics like deposits and player value to calculate exact ROAS.\n\nTo save time, I also keep a small local database with over 90 days of data so I don’t have to keep pinging the APIs every time. Everything runs through a simple Python script that cleans, structures, and formats the reports automatically for weekly, biweekly, or monthly periods.\n\nIt’s been a huge time saver and gives me a clear view across all my traffic sources.\n\nCurious if anyone else is building something similar or using AI agents to automate reporting in programmatic.

Mostly for the campaigns were for awareness only so I am just exposed on meeting impressions KPI. I have tried setting up displays on TTD, but same issue and I really believe I still have a lot of areas for me to explore. \n\nYes, I can take some online courses and do some self-learning, but I think the best way for me to really learn is to be on board of actual executions.\n\nI am not actually looking for a high-paying job, I just like to be in a space where learning is valued as much as performance with a team or mentor open to sharing insights and best practices.

For example, I might put all my video ads in one campaign group and all my display ads in another campaign group, each with their own set of campaigns optimized to do their own things, and then I can roll up campaign groups for easier reporting across channels.\n\nOther advertisers choose to throw all of their components into a single campaign group so that they can set frequency caps across all placements if they have more of a reach-focused strategy in mind. I always found that odd because an impression from CTV is worth a lot more than an impression from display, but I'm also not really in that sort of advertising space.\n\nNot sure if I'm really answering your question on this, but I think a \"Campaign Group\" is either to manage reach and frequency or simply make it easier to roll up reporting across multiple channels through naming conventions. Outside of that, I don't know if there's really a big performance upside.",

I’ve been in programmatic for roughly that same amount of time, and I really enjoy the work overall.\n\nSince starting here in September, though, I’ve noticed the pace is *insanely* fast. It often feels like we’re constantly chasing deadlines, always short-staffed, and everyone seems to be complaining about something. I know it’s part of the agency world, but sometimes it feels like we’re just firefighting all day.\n\nAnother thing I’ve noticed is that sometimes we’re asked to push certain products or “friendly” publishers due to internal agreements, which can make me feel a bit powerless or limited in doing what’s *actually* best for performance. I’m curious — for those of you working in big network agencies, especially in Europe, do you experience the same kind of politics or “preferred partner” pressure?\n\nAs for salary, I’m earning more than I did before, but from what I’ve heard, it’s still not particularly high compared to other roles in media. My plan is to treat this as a learning experience — kind of a training ground to grow my skills and hopefully progress in my career.\n\nWould love to hear if anyone else has gone through something similar or has advice on how to make the most out of this kind of environment.\n\nThanks!",

Is it learning how to consult with clients? Is it media excellence, is it \\*business\\* knowledge?\n\nTo get the most out of agency, you have to take a step back and really focus on what your \\*role\\* is in the business, and also understand how that role ladders up to what is really a giant money making machine.\n\nI've just finished 5 years and am getting out of agency now, but it's the place that has taught me more than I ever could have imagined. The real key is just figuring out how to make it work for you, and stopping every now and then to take stock of what you've learned.\n\nMore recently, I've gotten behind the scenes of how agencies make money, and, it's not pretty.\n\nTwo answer your two biggest questions\n\nThe pace and resource problem, big learning for me was, always ask yourself \"is this what my client asked for?\". Never add complexity to a process or solution, without there being commercial benefit. ie, if you pull together an advanced presentation for a client that they didn't ask for, then have a think about the trade off there. Yes it might be the best solution, but are you or the agency getting commercial benefit from that? Or would the more basic solution deliver comparable results, without adding complexity to process. When analysing your clients issues, tackle the low effort, high reward problems first, and move from there. Same goes in your internal processes, what small changes can have the largest impact?\n\nThose publisher biases you talk about, have a re-think about what optimal look likes. If your agency has $1million committed to a publisher, and that commitment helps unlock a 20% discount agency wide on a market rate, then your contribution to that commitment, \\*is\\* directly benefiting your client. The value in agencies is pooling spend to unlock efficiency. So when you're comparing Publisher A vs Publisher B, and one is an 95th percentile solution, and one is a 90th percentile solution, ask yourself if that 5 percentile points is worth \\*not\\* contributing to the agency deal, and helping preserve that favorable rate position for all clients.\n\nAll in all, agencies can be absolutely awful at times, but just focus on what \\*you\\* are learning. There's so much to learn, and so much of it is incredibly valuable for your journey, just make sure you're conscious what you're getting out of it.",

      "content": "WPP launched Open Pro, basically a self-serve version of its WPP Open platform. It’s designed to let marketers plan campaigns, create branded content, and launch ads, all without going through an agency.\n\nAccording to their announcement, Open Pro has three parts:\n\n* Plan: Use AI trained on WPP’s data to build campaign strategies and audience insights.\n* Create: Auto-generate brand-safe creative using tools like Google’s Veo, OpenAI’s Sora, and Adobe Firefly \n* Publish: Either push content straight to ad platforms or route through WPP’s Open Media Studio.\n\nPricing is usage-based after an initial access fee, so it’s structured more like a software platform than an agency engagement.\n\n  \nWhen WPP hired Cindy Rose from Microsoft earlier this year, it signaled a shift from services to platforms. Rose helped lead Microsoft’s transition from a product company to a full-fledged platform business, and it seems she’s now trying to apply the same strategy at WPP.\n\nWPP Open is starting to look like Salesforce for advertising:\n\n* Smaller brands and in-house teams can pay for access to WPP’s AI tools.\n* Agencies might license their data clean room or creative automation features.\n* WPP stops competing for smaller clients and starts extracting value from the entire ad supply chain.\n\nThis could mark a major turning point for holding companies. Instead of acting as service providers, they’re evolving into infrastructure that others in the industry depend on.\n\nIn some ways, it’s a new approach, but also a familiar one. We’ve seen similar attempts before, back when trading desks first appeared in the early 2010s.\n\nSo I’ve got a few questions:  \n\\- Could WPP really pull off a Microsoft-style transformation?  \n\\- Will it eat into the potential income of smaller independent agencies?",

So I wonder how I can start working on implementing this website with oRTB and other SSPs (PubMatic, BidSwitch, Appnexus, Rubicon, Pulsepoint, Freewheel). \n4) I assume integrations are most commonly done by the developers, if that's the case, what this role expects me to do. I've searched a lot, but I haven't been able to wrap my head around the end to end approach that someone in the integration role would do. \n\nAny help would do wonders!\n\n\nDescription:\n•Own supply integrations via Header Bidding, ORTB protocol, and RTB/PMP. • Lead SSP onboarding, managing endpoints, tags, and feeds with accuracy. \n• Manage DSP onboarding, ensuring compatibility and smooth daily operations (PubMatic, BidSwitch, etc.).\n• Oversee end-to-end ad operations and publisher account management across CTV, Video, Display, and In-App.\n• Audit publisher integrations to ensure data integrity, fraud detection, fill rates, and error resolution.\n\nThanks for your time:)",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m running a campaign in DV360 and seeing something that doesn’t quite make sense.  \nThere’s a very high number of post-view conversions and almost no post-click conversions, even though the gclid is being passed correctly — I’ve tested it manually and the click-based conversions register fine.\n\nCTR is quite low across all line items, but what really confuses me is that the best-performing creatives are retargeting ones — shown only to users who already added a product to their cart. These ads include discounts of up to 60% that can only be accessed through the ad URL.\n\nAs a user, I would normally click an ad like that (if only to not lose the discount URL), so it’s odd to see people supposedly converting without clicking.\n\nI was looking at the “Time To Conversion” metric to get a sense of the delay between the impression and the conversion, but the UI doesn’t specify any units — I can’t tell if it’s in days, hours, or something else, and the documentation isn’t clear either.\n\nHas anyone experienced similar behavior? Is this kind of post-view inflation normal for DV360 retargeting?  \nAlso, what’s the best way to confirm that the impressions truly come from DV360 and not from another channel that might be firing the same Floodlight tag?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights.\n\n\n\n",

This is pretty much 2010 digital marketing mindset that forgets you cannot click on cable tv ads.  Attribution is a very complecated and deep branch of marketing, not a topic to be closed with 'I would normally click an ad'.\n\n  \nOverall, your post contains many presumptions that you may not even be aware of. I think you are relatively new to digital.  You are asking if x is normal, then assuming that there is some 'inflation' happening.\n\n>what’s the best way to confirm that the impressions truly come from DV360 and not from another channel that might be firing the same Floodlight tag\n\nThis is just nonsense. Are you really asking if there is somebody who knows you are running a campaign via DV360, is reapeadetly creating new cookies to be caught by rtg setup in DV360, and then goes to the website to PURCHASE something? I would be very happy if I had someone permanently purchasing shit from my clients lol.",

I imagine that for DV360, it could be that theres not much difference between baseball and hockey fans. \n\nCPA in MLB campaign was great until the day after the Stanley Cup was over. subscriptions idried up the day after - and for the next 3 months I could not make the campaign perform. Tactics that worked well while hockey was on, had a 10x increase in CPA. \n\nIn my opinion, the volume of Hockey-skewed data messed up the bidder in the Baseball campaign since: \n\n* large volume hockey visitors converted and got attributed to baseball campaign via retargeting/broad sports targeting \n\n* algos/bidder kept intaking audience and placement signals that worked while Hockey was on and trying to find users similar to those that converted in April-May. \n\n\n\nSo, my questions are: \n\n* how do you think i can go about minimizing cross attribution given that the client wont build separate landing pages per sport and 90% of conversions are post-view\n\n* how do you feel about my theory of feeding wrong data signals to the bidder for 3 months, which made it basically impossible to recover and find a new audience (baseball audience) after? \n\n\nCurious to hear your answers!

You can then use this in the next point\n* DV360 Custom Bidding may be useful in this situation vs optimising purely to the Floodlight on its own\n* Assuming there are other pages on the website specific to MLB / NHL, you can do something smart with 1st party cookies to tie this to the final purchase as a custom variable, to somewhat infer what the user may use the subscription for.

I assume that a big chunk of converted users \"attributed\" to MLB campaign were also actually hockey fans, who got served an ad from the MLB campaign as they were browsing a relevant website. \n\nI have a theory that all these conversions, which most likely were hockey fans, really messed up DV360's bidder as for 2.5 months. Incorrect data signal was being fed to the bidder and it couldn't re-configure itself as the hockey demand has dried up. \n\n  \nThinking about it now, I wonder if creating new line items from scratch in DV360 would sort of \"reset\" the bidder and let it learn anew.\n\n  \nWhat are your thoughts on that?

The Trade Desk’s CMO Ian Colley called the tests “unfair,” arguing that Amazon performs well mainly because it directs spend toward its own properties rather than the open web.\n\nBut on the other side of the battlefield, AWS is getting defensive.  \nAs Google Cloud has been offering incentives and compute credits to lure ad tech companies over, AWS risked losing one of its most data-heavy verticals.\n\nNow it’s countering with RTB Fabric, a new real-time bidding infrastructure built inside AWS.\n\nIf two partners are on AWS within the same data center, they can communicate in microseconds instead of milliseconds, drastically cutting latency and networking costs (reportedly by up to 80%).\n\nThis aligns with AWS’s broader philosophy of “plug-and-play” openness, modularity, decentralization, and interoperability.\n\nRTB Fabric isn’t an open marketplace by itself but it fits right into that infrastructure mindset, giving ad tech firms more flexibility and control than Google’s more closed, vertically integrated ecosystem.\n\nThat last point matters.  \nGoogle is no longer seen as a “safe” infrastructure partner, not just because of competition, but due to mounting antitrust scrutiny. Many ad tech firms are understandably hesitant to run their operations on the same stack owned by a company being investigated for ad market dominance.\n\nAWS, by contrast, can credibly present itself as a more neutral infrastructure provider. even if everyone knows Amazon has its own motives.\n\nAnd there’s another layer:  \nas AI takes over ad tech, infrastructure needs will explode. The compute, data processing, and real-time modeling required for AI-driven ad optimization all funnel directly into AWS’s core business.

It constantly crashes every browser. It is not flexible with complex audiences or geotargets which you have to recreate every single time. It's invoicing systems are broken. It's reporting interface and features are one of the worst I've ever seen.\n\nEveryone who speculates that Amazon is going to take massive market-share has not been in their platform to set up media. I can not imagine a fortune 500 advertiser who can function in that thing and run massive national media campaigns.\n\nOh and now their core day to day support teams are gone.",

But Amazon is losing every front because they dont do things right, only care to undercut competitors prices avoiding taxes, but in Ad spending, the cheapest is not better. They can give their services for free, but they Will fk their customers when the time comes, Just look at their shutdown on mmo gaming, fkn their costumers who invested time and money, then aws services keep crashing and more expensive, Amazon retailers having expensive fees each year.

Dear Lord, I can automate campaigns, but I can't automate the process of others understanding me.\n\nRecently, I've been trying to start a new side hustle as a remote freelancer. Working with companies from different cultural backgrounds and fields makes it even more difficult. I've tried using tools to help me express myself more clearly. For example, I use Claude Code to clean up messy logic, Notion AI to generate summaries of what I say, and Beyz interview helper to explain my work, avoiding sounding like a jumble of technical stack information. I even had GPT do the translation... (exaggeration) In short, translating our actual work into plain, understandable language is really difficult.\n\nMy communication skills aren't great, so I always feel like half of this job is about learning how to explain things. If anyone has good analogies to share, I'll diligently study the art of speaking.",

Just wrapped up a round one screening with a recruiter and the next steps are a data presentation with a Q & A after. Apparently they give us a client, some data from said client, and then we present about it?? Idk, just trying to prepare myself!\n\nBasically just looking for some insight on if anyone has gone through this process ",
