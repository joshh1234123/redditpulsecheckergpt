      "content": "I’m curious to hear others’ experiences with what types of media ads have worked best for local businesses.\n\nI own a small IT services company and have been experimenting with different DSPs and platforms to see what actually moves the needle. So far, I’ve had the best response through **Amazon DSP** and **DV360**, running campaigns between **6–11pm**. I even got tagged in a few local Facebook groups where residents mentioned seeing my streaming TV ad which was great to see. Honestly, I think I might be one of the only small businesses in my area (or maybe even the state) doing any kind of programmatic advertising.\n\nI’ve also tested **DOOH**, including **in-theater ads** (about 20 theaters for two weeks — zero response), **screens in gyms, grocery stores, and retail** (also zero), and **digital billboards** via **Admatx (The Trade Desk)** targeting two local Lamar signs. The signs were impossible to miss — one-lane each way, 40mph road — but after a month (5pm–7pm rotation), I saw no measurable response.\n\n**YouTube Instant Guaranteed** got plenty of views but no noticeable leads. \n\nI also ran an **audio campaign** on Admatx across multiple platforms for two weeks, again zero response.\n\nAt this point, it really seems like **streaming TV** is the clear winner for local brand recognition. People notice it, comment on it, and we get actual leads from it. Sure, I could keep testing DOOH or audio for a few more months, but if one channel is delivering consistent awareness and results, it makes sense to double down there.\n\nThat said, I’m really curious, for those who work with **local businesses**, what ad types or strategies have you found to be most effective in generating real leads/sales?\n\nHappy to share more about all the tools and DSPs I’ve used if anyone’s interested.

If you can do targeted CTV buys locally it probably is your best bet, but you're in IT which in and of itself is a niche industry.\n\nI'm helping a few clients right now with exactly this - in finserv, real estate, and CPG.  At local / small scale you're unfortunately stuck with Search and Social.  Your best bet is to run a few tests and really hone your keywording and headlines / descriptions. On social a/b test with some creatives.  You might have some more luck with video on social, and think about TikTok.  There's a point of diminishing returns especially at the local level because there's only so many people you can target who would realistically engage with your brand.",

Great to hear real experiences after all the trial and error.\n\nStreaming works, but it’s about looking at the full picture — direct attribution, incremental growth like branded search lift, organic traffic, and how brand awareness affects conversions and cart value compared to those who didn’t see the ads.\n\nHow are you attributing leads with pixel on top of phone calls?\n\nLocal targeted streaming makes a lot of sense once brands hit diminishing returns on search and social. We’re seeing strong results for local businesses at that stage.\nEspecially for products or services with wide appeal and $200+ cart value.",

Additional CTV coverage and metrics \n\n4.

If you toggle cross-device concept to off, every conversion moving forward will not be measured via cross device. If you change the vendor from identiy alliance to adbrain, every conversion after the change will be measured only using adbrain's graph. They are 4 total providers, with liveramp being the only option that is more expensive, Identity alliance combines all 3 providers providing more scale (at least im pretty sure thats how it was explained to me). Although I'm pretty sure TTD doesn't charge for measurement, only for audience expansion, but looking at the fees section they may have changed this now.\n\nHonestly, what i would do is create a new reporting column with the same conversion action, not set any cross device measurement on there and compare over time. you'll likely see more conversions in the reporting column with identity alliance turned on. but if you don't, then you'll know that it's likely a feature not worth paying for in future campaigns.\n\nJust be warned that changing reporting columns mid campaign gets really messy and could really screw up your reporting, so I wouldn't change any existing reporting columns unless you're confident you can mitigate any ill effect.",

I have recently found myself in a company that has 0 understanding of programmatic and only do direct deals for their gambling affiliated display content. As part of my new remit they want me to prove the value of programmatic by capitalising on around 270 million unfilled impressions worldwide. \n\nI have been able to set up an ad server / SSP (GAM), implemented some fairly standard ad sizes, mobile banner, top leaderboard, MPU's etc and have also implemented some KVP's for ATF/BTF and ad placement. However the fill rate currently is still very low around 5% with a £0.90 floor price. As I have never really worked in optimising delivery, I am asking if anyone has some helpful advice that could aid in filling the inventory space more consistently (was hoping for 50-60%)? I have a vague understanding of yield groups and could potentially look at utilising other SSP's to open up to more advertising traffic. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated for a newbie in this space!",
