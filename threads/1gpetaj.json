      "body": "Fraud is a game of whack-a-mole and comes in many shapes, some are publishers but some will be driven by infected devices.\n\nHow are you reporting the fraud to know there is an issue? If it's being reported by a specific measurement vendor aligning their prebid feature should help lower fraud being purchased. \n\nPrebid fraud segment should also reduce your manual whack-a-mole, would definitely suggest applying these segments where available (if you don't have a vendor on measurement just pick one for prebid) \n\nAds.txt and app-ads.txt - in the past a lot of fraud was pretending to be a premium publisher, make sure these are enabled on the DSP to only buy authorised inventory and if you have fraud issues I'd consider even being stricter to Direct only if it doesn't kill your scale to also cut out resellers. \n\nUser similarweb or such site to help sense check suspicious sites in reports, this is really helpful if you also want to strip MFA (although they aren't inherently fraud they can be low value) did a site volume suddenly explode? What are their traffic sources?\nMore manual but you might get enough info out the free version.",

      "body": "From the marketing perspective, this is where consumer surveys can come in handy. They won't help you identify bots, but they can help you focus your resources on the services/keywords/ that are actually generating conversions. \n\n\nIncentivizing responses is a beast of a problem, though, especially with low-volume sales. If your conversion is 1-5%, then your response rate from those conversions is probably 1-5% or less. I've had a few people recommend giving discount codes for completed surveys, which could help",

Since the data at prebid level is self declared by publisher. \nUse a full funnel monitoring solution (like mFilterIt) where you monitor impressions to clicks to visits to actual events and look at how the users journey is. \nAlso this is not a space for manual work and needs automated handling since bots are quick and fast and manual analysis doesn’t help.",
