      "body": "Hi! I am not sure what tags you mean exactly but I need to send clicktrackers to publishers. When you’ve set up your placement, creative and tracking, you can go to the top right where it says tags (I think so, not 100% sure but I can double check tomorrow if needed) and then click download tags.\nFrom there you can download a tag per placement and select what you want in there.\nI download them as a text file and then test the ‘for clicks’ url that it shows.\nKeep in mind that if you test the url (copy paste into a browser) it can take some time sometimes to work as CM360 needs to sync. Sometimes for me it works after an hour but I also had cases where it took much longer.\n\nHope this helps!",

For example, assume I want to show my ads in bbc\\[.\\]com. To which mail id I must send the tags to? Do these publishers have individual email ids where we can send the tags to?",

      "body": "Oke check! Yes I usually send them to the publishers myself and give each of them a separate tag with a different url so I can track the performance per publisher. They should have an email for a progammatic team usually or I sometimes send them to my contact person. If you cannot find it, i sometimes just use their general email to ask who is the best to share this with.\n\nHowever if you use their inventory within dv360 then I don’t send clicktrackers.",
