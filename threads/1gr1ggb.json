      "body": "MRAID is just a specification. In that spec, there are examples of JS code that you can use.\nI've never heard of Next.js, so I can't comment on that.\n\nWhatever code you use, you'll need to comply with MRAID to get access to the features of the phone that'll let you enrich the UX.\nIt's critical you manage the non-access to certain features of the phone. Indeed, user can control what to give access to or not. Ex: GPS.\n\nI might be mistaken, but I'm not sure there's any library that's readily MRAID compliant for the simple reason is that certain companies have theirs and use them as a USP.\n\nHope it'll help even though I'm not sharing much.",

      "body": "Thanks for the insights! This is super helpful. Just to confirm, I understand that MRAID compliance requires careful handling of user permissions, especially for features like GPS. When you mention companies having their own MRAID libraries as unique selling points, it makes sense why open-source options might be limited.\n\nJust to clarify, Next.js is a React framework for frontend development, which I’m using to deploy rich media executions directly on a URL that our ad ops team can use. Is there a way to make these URLs MRAID-compliant for in-app environments?\n\nIf I’m using Next.js and standard JavaScript, would you suggest starting by directly implementing the MRAID JavaScript functions provided in the spec? Or would it be better to wrap this functionality in a custom library to handle permissions and events smoothly?\n\nAlso, do you have any recommendations for testing MRAID ads on actual devices, given the differences in permissions/access across devices? Any preferred testing tools or debugging tips would be great to hear about.",

      "body": "Hi bro\nSorry, I'll keep it short:\n1- for the testing part, highly recommend to do it on all major SSPs' SDKs. Most of them have apps in stores to let you test. And you can simulate user permissions directly on the device you test on.\n2- highly recommended you run a small campaign where the scripts you're willing to use are added to the ad and are loaded. You don't need to execute any of that code, but simply add it to the creative and make sure it's loaded. This is a critical test to check that SSPs/DSPs or their (f*ing) Ad Verification tools won't block your ads because of those scripts.\n3- highly recommended you host any code on your servers and use a legit domain (forget cloudflare urls or even a freshly acquired domain). This is to prevent the issues that might arise as described in 2.\n\nHope it'll help and look fwd to see some nice enriched ads!",
