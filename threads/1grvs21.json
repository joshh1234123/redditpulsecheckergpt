They're not really going to convert anytime soon. Its a heavy awareness medium and not much above that.\n\nIt would be better to do a path to conversion analysis to see where OTT sits and how that contributes to the overall picture",

So if they're running that, they should be looking to see if they're getting a bump in site traffic through other channels after implementing an awareness channels or seeing if they get bumps in conversions at all.\n\nYou have to boil it back down to user behavior, so think of your own or ask your client to think of their own...You watch CTv/OTT and see an ad, what do you do if its interesting? You open your phone and most Millennial and over will go to Google (so search gets the credit) and younger generations will hop on social media....now those users are either converting from those channels or those channels are picking them up for HEAVY re-targeting to take credit for the conversion.\n\n  \nSo it's likely you're influencing the conversion, but you're not getting last click, they need to implemented an attribution model of sorts.",

      "body": "This is extremely vague so not sure how to help without more information. Programmatic campaigns vary vastly depending on channel, KPI, and many other factors. \n\nWhat DSP are you using (tier 1, 2 or 3)? What are budgets and channels? What inventory are you leveraging? Is the clients goal Conversion Rate, Cost per Conversion, raw conversions, or other? Are you just running on LAL models or are there other strategies being used? How and how often are you optimizing your campaigns? I could go on....\n\nUltimately if they are looking for conversions as a KPI, Search and Social will win out on last touch attribution models and MMM studies so it's not surprising they are trying to shift towards them. We have seen time and time again, once a client stops programmatic spend their numbers suffer. Utilizing a multitouch attribution model can help. If you use the Trade Desk they have a Path to Conversion report to illustrate this across channels run in the DSP.",

Sounds like you’re in over your head and if you think your client is a super great bunch of people you are in further over your head. How many years of programmatic experience do you have? Is this client putting all eggs in one basket? Any other channels? Is search being affected? So your doing OTT B2B? How relevant is your product to that target audience?",
