(I own a media trading agency FYI, I can probably give you pointers to where to go, free of course. It's important to help out each other)\n\nYou can check this to see which one I would advise: [https://blog.tedjordan.org/advertising/platforms/best-dsps-programmatic-advertising/](https://blog.tedjordan.org/advertising/platforms/best-dsps-programmatic-advertising/)",
