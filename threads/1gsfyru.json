      "body": "As a trader of 7+ years, I also dream of creating a DSP with a modern UI. I don't understand why no one can create a useful pacing sheet in the platform itself. I shouldn't have to use excel everyday for optimizations. And the platform should make it easier to find trends within data to generate insights that are actually helpful to an advertiser. It would be difficult to get any traction at large hold cos, but I think it could work with smaller agencies with smaller budgets. Basically, you'd be competing with StackAdapt and not TTD/DV360/Amazon.\n\n  \nThere are also a gang of \"CTV PaaS\" advertising platforms for smaller advertisers popping up that aren't really DSPs but probably built on top of those types of pipes though that seem to be getting popular. Super simplistic, super minimal UI. Might be an interesting place to start doing some research for something more niche.",

Just one major event should give you a clear idea: Mediamath. They went bankrupt a few weeks before I joined them.\n\nI hear you about UI and transparency. Any respected Product Manager would care about those, but it's just impossible given how low the margins are and the number of investors to keep happy.\n\nAnd forget about SSP side as well. It's more opaque and the size matters more than he DSP side.\n\nIt's my opinion, but don't get discouraged by my brutal description of the reality.",

I've come from a background of having a proprietary DSP that won Fortune 500 clients. \nThere are definitely newer entrants like Adlook in the market right now, where the USP may focus on fraud or integrations with Privacy Enhancing Tech like Google Privacy Sandbox. But ultimately it is a struggle to compete with the Tier 1 DSPs.",

You won't be able to cut fees in half most likely because that takes large partnerships and scale integrations...it's been a race to the bottom for the last few years and the margins are thin from an overall perspective. It's either super expensive to build an in-depth platform so you'll be in a bad spot right from the start....if you don't build the latest and greatest then it wont scale bc ppl don't see the value and it's a tough sell. Margins are so low already, I just don't see it I'm sorry.",

Or UI functionalities\n\nFrom there I'd start doing market research and identify what functionalities traders/specialists are looking for specifically. I'd aim to avoid junior holdco level specialists, as one holdco's will so hard to crack in the early stages, but also their lack of experience may not give the best answer.\n\nBeen trading programmatically for over 6 years now and have worked with every major and some smaller DSPs, so if you ever want to chat shoot me a DM!",

      "body": "Thanks for all the thoughts. Pacing is a great fundamental example where I think 99% of the frustrations could be solved by the technology. There's like 3-4 basic things that pacing should do and most platforms that I've been in do only 1 of them and do it poorly.\n\nI don't know why it's this way though. My quick thought is it's a symptom of how software companies are run now, with so few product managers, and so many engineers who have little responsibility outside of completing tickets on a board. The product managers are in charge of 100 features and keeping new sales and higher ups happy, and there's no person who is empowered to make sure pacing is firing on all cylinders.\n\nThere should be someone in charge of pacing who wakes up in the morning and is like OK how are we gonna make pacing better today? It's that important IMO.\n\nI've recently been getting back into the CTV game at work and have been working with a lot of folks using SpringServe and Publica, and have found it fairly interesting. I haven't seen much new on the demand side but I am somewhat isolated now. We have some business coming with Adtelligent which is maybe the sort of platform you are talking about.\n\nNiche would be good if I could find the right fit..",
