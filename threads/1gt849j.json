      "body": "$300k/month to get users to install an EV charging app? This seems like a very steep budget for what I'd assume is a potentially niche app, depending on the app's owner. (charging network, or car manufacturer)\n\nWhat are they expecting to see in return for that $300k a month? If they're expecting you to get thousands of new app users through the door, I think you might struggle with programmatic activations despite technically having everything in place to run a successful app-install campaign.\n\nUnless you can share more information on what the client is expecting to see, I'd advice focusing your budget on more successful channels listed below. (Meta, Moloco etc.)",
