      "body": "Unfortunately the advice in this subreddit isn't great when it comes to specialist niches like gambling. Look at a DSP that's friendly with gambling - Match2One is good, and also Adform could be good here as alot of casinos now run here.\n\nPop networks should still be okay with Indian traffic. Just expect extremely low conversion rates. You can try big networks like Propeller Ads and Traffic Junky. Or smaller netoworks like Explorads",
