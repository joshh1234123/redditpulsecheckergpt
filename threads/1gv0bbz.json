      "body": "There is always a learning curve with a DSP, so sometimes it's easier to just utilize a partner. Additionally the top tier DSP's are going to require Minimums (which you may not hit at $30K a month) and the no minimum DSP's you're going to sacrifice features and options. But you also need to weary about 3rd party media buying \"platforms\" that are essentially middlemen and will cut corners to offer you low CPM's (first hand experience with this, so now I look for solution providers that actually own something/have skin in the game). \n\n\n\nOutside of B2C, what are you trying to accomplish? Are you looking for 3rd party audiences or looking to leverage 1st party data? What type of product or service?",

Running display and video for a national campaign AND a wide audience that isn’t highly defined will burn through that $ very quickly.\nMy immediate thought it is consider your expectations. If it is to have immediate impact on conversions right away you will be very lucky to achieve that with or without an agency helping. \nYou CAN put together a campaign that will teach you a lot more about your audiences and start to guide them through a slower sequence of ads to keep interest until the full launch of your product.\nFull disclosure that I work for a smaller DSP operating out of Toronto. I will happily chat more about its self-serve functionality if you like.",

In short, as a media trading agency (focusing 100% on programmatic), we can typically have 2-5 times better performances then others just because we understand really well the ecosystem. \n\n  \nAlso, working with someone that can negociate a good deal for the platform fees and DMP prices will probably save you all the fees you would have paid anyway. \n\n  \nOne VERY important thing is transparency though. You should get a media trader that will show full transparency over what he buys, otherwise he would probably take from you. \n\n  \nThe DSP actually is a very important consideration (trust me DSPs DO NOT perform the same on cost metrics, you can sometime have 2-5 fold differences).

If you're not sure you're going to continue with programmatic, I'd look into whether you can activate self-serve and get a seat without minimums from a tier 2 DSP (Stack, Basis etc.) as you definitely won't cut it for TTD or DV360. As you have the programmatic expertise I'd recommend taking it in-house, if programmatic scales up you can then decide whether or not it should be outsourced to an agency",

You are at a good ad spend to decide between Agency or direct.  \n\nBest part of working with an Agency is you can leverage more than one DSP sometimes OR you can use a very skilled team. Our programmatic buyers can get more value out of your spend out the gate that you most likely would as you learn.  \n\nAnd a lot of Agencies have a trade desk seat so you can use someone like us to try it out for 3 months or so. Then decide to roll with an Agency going forward or pursure being on a DSP yourself.  \n\nDownside to running programmatic direct really comes down to how good your support team is. And how much you have to spend. For like $30k of spend per month you might not get an A team from mid-size DSP but you will have a good amount of options. \n\nIf you are interested in chatting more - hit me up.
