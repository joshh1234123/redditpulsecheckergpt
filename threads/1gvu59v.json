      "body": ">“we could never beat AI”\n\nThis is extremely troubling, and sounds like a sales pitch, not actionable information. I know that Alphabet has been pushing as much automated infrastructure as possible because its more cost effective and 'delivers conversions/clicks', but I haven't really seen any studies or research that backs that up. I don't like that they're pushing a specific setup just for their own benefit, its skeevy\n\nIf you have a system that works for you, that gives you the feedback that you need to continue doing business, then there isn't any reason to change, especially if the new service gives you less information and less control. If the sales rep has a problem with that, well thats on them. If they want to mandate having a single line item, then corporate can go ahead and set the mandate.",

Ever since I've started in programmatic buying, I've always worked with lines of the mediaplan with fixed budgets also activated in the DSP in the same way to make reporting and budget management as straightforward as possible. I'd be skeptical of just blindly following the Google recommendation as you'll lose so much control. FYI this push has been happening on most social platforms for years and all our social teams continuously keep pushing back and just doing what they deem best.
