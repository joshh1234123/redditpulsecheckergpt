      "body": "Costs: increased charges for data, cross device targeting, brand lift measurement, less reach into iOS than DV360 in my experience after iOS14. \n\nBenefits: No charge for cross device measurement, better inventory supply (TTD blocks lots of resellers by default that DV360 allows), lower SSP fees (AdX is almost always 20% vs other SSPs at 10-17%, if you buy OpenPath ad server direct PMPs it’s 0%), more access and scale for CTV inventory, more access and scale for audio inventory, more transparency (log level data available whereas DV360 is only available in blinded ADH), deeper reporting in the UI, better service (albeit skewed towards higher spending accounts), PG deals can be paused in the UI of TTD but not DV360.",

DV360 solely relied on IDFA for targeting in CTV, so if an impression come with IP but no IDFA and you are applying an audience then you’re leaving a sizeable chunk of the avails on the table.\n\nDV360 also struggles to apply Google walled garden data to non-walled garden inventory. \n\nAdditionally DV360 seems to be reticent to integrate bidding at the ad server level, meaning pubs like Tubi, Spotify, and eventually Netflix, will all be more expensive in DV360 vs TTD bc they require an SSP with the SSP fee to handle the avails.",

My work in ADH as a well as testing the brand lift product for CTV has seemed to indicate Google has a major actually resolving identity between these two ecosystems, and DV360 is charging you a 4% tax you don’t pay in Google Ads for YouTube, so if the overlap of these mediums doesn’t outweigh that (best way to evaluate if write a query in ADH for your CTV user ids overlapped with YouTube user IDs) then the 4% is potentially a wasteful fee.",
