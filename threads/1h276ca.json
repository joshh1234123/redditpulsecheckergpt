And if they are insuring themselves in case of problems, I’m even more concerned. Another strange thing? A 60-day lookback window on campaigns that are all post-view. I’m trying to be objective and see if I’m missing something, but it really doesn’t seem safe to me.",

I work for a large DSP and we throw a lot of money out. I ran install campaigns basically for free for some of our clients when experimenting with new models. \nI imagine small companies can't afford that. \n60 days post view is indeed strange. Post click CPA sounds better",

But I’m afraid that the attributions in this case are too messy: in 60 days, or even just 10 days after viewing an ad, many things can happen that might convince the user to register. Does the banner influence the decision? In some cases, yes, but why should I pay for users who might register organically anyway or due to other activities?",

      "body": "Hey hey!I would say, you probably just pointed out their biggest flow with that last comment. I personally have a media trading agency and whenever I see agencies offer this sort of payment model what that means is:  \n“We are performant only in post-view so if your brand is making a lot of organic sales we will make money out of you using the CPA and rev share part, otherwise we loose nothing with the impression payment”  \nI would honestly refuse this proposal. Either they commit to a CPA or rev share fully, or they go fully for impression. Regardless, 60 days post view is a joke I have to say  ( most DSPs cannot even keep the user data for more than 30 days so it means optimizing on CPM more than anything…)Your best bet probably is to research more and maybe try to understand it by yourself maybe with a consultant or freelance?!Hope that helps ;)",
