Their premium living room quality inventory is only as such because they use text transforms to take the actual inventory identification then rename it to whatever tf they want then display it in a new column field they made up called “Network Name”. They dont reveal app name, app id, deal id, publisher name, or site/url raw data that would be available through TTD’s API or batch reports.  Most of the impression inventory and budget goes to “Network Name” “NBC” which seems like a pretty big catch-all.",

[Magnite](https://www.magnite.com/blog/qa-how-mntns-ctv-strategy-tackles-challenges-with-magnite/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) \n\nThat said, what is under the hood, is probably Beeswax, which is now part of FreeWheel which runs it's own CTV marketplace.  In that CTV marketplace TTD drives a significant amount of demand. \n\nWhat makes this interesting, is that FreeWheel is still a hugely popular CTV adserver for CTV publisher.\n\nRegardless they have a team that supports PMP deals, yet doesn't have the meaningful demand-clout to get ROAS impact.",
