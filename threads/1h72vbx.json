      "body": "Based on your description, it's not entirely clear whether you're currently working at an agency or at an advertiser. If you're at an agency, I'd highly encourage to try and juggle both and become more advanced in your knowledge of both channels to hopefully guide where you might want to take your career.\n\nI've done exactly what I've outlined above juggling social & programmatic mediabuying at a big 6 agency for the first 2.5-3 years of my career as I wasn't yet sure whether I'd wanna grow into more of a generalist or a true specialist. After 3 years, I've fully switched into programmatic and in particular the more technical side of things, combining it with team management as I knew I'd ultimately wanna transition out of agency life into an ad-tech role which I believed this would set me up for the best.\n\nIf you're currently working at an advertiser and not too sure on where you might want to take your career then it might be worth exploring agency roles to learn a lot for a couple of years. From agencies it's easy to transition into a lot of different directions. e.g., client side, publisher, platform/ad-tech etc.",

      "body": "Hi, thanks for the guidance. I’m currently working at an agency and I have a smaller client so we’re really limited in what social or programmatic ads we can run due to the small budget. Thus, I haven’t gotten into the granular of the platform like optimizations or pulling specific reports. Also all our ads have the same objective so I feel like it’s a lot of duplicating campaigns in this role thus why I feel like I won’t be learning as much in the long run. \n\nI was also contemplating staying for 1-2 more years but I’m not sure how to advance my knowledge at the moment since my team currently is new and they don’t have any programmatic knowledge with the tradedesk platform to help me learn more. \n\nDo you have any trainings or recommendations on how I can expand my knowledge on my own time.",

See if you could register for some of the U of Digital trainings from a company training budget or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, if you feel like there's no room to grow or learn more at your current agency it might be worth seeking out a challenging side-project to work on alongside your daily tasks which will help you develop",
