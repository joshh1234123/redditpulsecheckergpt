It’s mostly just random text ads or static ads in Googles O&O, includes GSP and GVP, and gives 0 transparency for what it is buying inside of Googles walls.\n2. If you set up conversions broadly, it really only optimizes to the larger scale conversion event. \n3. Outside of Google O&O, it’s largely just programmatic in app inventory inside of Googles AdMob tech. Lots of kids apps can appear in your delivery (soo many clicks!)\n4. The Creative is largely a white banner with big text that probably isn’t even your brand name: I.e. ORDER PIZZA HERE vs DOMINOES with a tiny logo slapped on. Lots of 320x50 units too.",

You just compare the placements and fees to figure that out. It's likely going to depend on the campaigns themselves. You should be able to run ads on all the major display placements from any of those options.\n\nEdit: You're aware that TTD is not really designed for small in house campaigns correct?",

Yikes, I think the consensus is that Google is a monopoly that is going to do whatever they want and whether you like it or not is too bad. It's not doing anything that a human being can't do and a human being with experience should be many times more effective, so I would say no. I don't see how it's possible that a consensus of people think that. I mean maybe if you compare \"out of the box\" campaign settings... If you actually set the campaigns up intelligently, then no, how is that possible?\n\nWhat does \"performance\" even mean? Like it makes Google more money than other DSPs? Yeah for sure... I'm sure that people \"stumbling\" into display advertising with zero experience performs extremely well for Google... If you're talking about cost effectiveness, then absolutely not. I would say that depends on the media buyer and their skills. Which, apparently people don't value skills and would rather have an AI that is usually wrong do it for them. You can just let the algorithm bid on placements that a human knows to avoid... I don't know why anybody thinks that a good idea... You know, besides Google...\n\nYou know, usually the way this process starts is by analyzing the customers and their interests, then making a list of placements where it would make logical sense to have ads there... Not throwing remarketing code on a page and letting the algo do whatever it wants... It's kind of the exact opposite of a good strategy...",
