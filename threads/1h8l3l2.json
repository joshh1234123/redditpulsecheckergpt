Just be forthcoming about what business outcome your client is looking for and where they want their message seen (time square v gas station tv)… Not what KPI, but true business objective.  If you focus on a kpi for DOOH, you’re looking at impresssions, delivery, etc. check out Causal iQ, MIQ, Vistar (I think they still have managed service), adomni, all can help with something like this.",
