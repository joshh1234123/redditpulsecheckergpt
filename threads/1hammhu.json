      "body": "I work for one of the major DSPs and this is a common discussion with clients. Some DSPs like TTD will be transparent about the margins, but they have minimums as well as other fees which can add up easily. Some others will include a lot of features but have an undisclosed variable-margin bid mechanism.\n\nI recommend that you should test 3-4 DSPs at the same time and see which platform gives you what you need the most, at the best price first. You may be surprised with the results since the obvious ones might not be the answer. This will help you identify targeting capabilities, available insights, recommended optimizations and support. Once you have the results, pick 2 of the platforms that closely align with the KPIs you are looking to hit.\n\nLastly, the volume of money you spend would give you room to negotiate. Once you know what your acquisition costs are, you can negotiate volume discounts on amount payable. I have negotiated similar margin contracts before where they get a 5% discount for spend over $ XX or 10% discount on payable over $ YY spend and so on. But this really works when you have a large budget. For smaller budgets or campaigns running with regionality, I do feel that having more features and better support goes much further than a pre-negotiated margin.",

      "body": "Transparency is an interesting thing, what do you mean by that? Are you referring to the ability to pull fee reporting on a granular level? Or want the UI to call out if there is a charge associated? Are you looking to see how much the DSP is making from everything? All DSPs obscure things to a degree but there is rarely a time where they are charging you for nothing. ex. Dv360 pushes more bids toward their owned SSP to make money on both sides of the impression. TTD has predictive clearing which will use platform wide bids to lower your bids to get the lowest price and takes a 25% fee on the savings you got. Both can save you money, but you have to pay a fee to get that.   \n  \n  \nI think your tech fee is going to be dependent on spend potential among other factors. Working for one of the larger DSPs, tech fee is flexible depending on portfolio size, region, sector, etc. The more budget/growth potential the more a DSP is willing to negotiate. If you have multiple DSPs it may seem like a positive but unless you have enough budget you could be missing out on massive savings. Furthermore it becomes hard to optimize performance when you have to juggle multiple DSPs. If you have 1st party data too, it can become costly to upload to multiple DSPs.\n\n  \nUltimately for performance buys, it sometimes pays more to pay more. DSPs all offer differing levels of support, tech, and features that make it hard to recommend without knowing your orgs specific needs. You can give rough recommendations, ex. Use the Google ecosystem for ad serving and need YouTube; DV360 is a good fit. Or have a lot of retail data and want to leverage exclusive data segments, Amazon might be best. But neither of these offer great support and troubleshooting, if you need best in class support, TTD is probably best. Need to white label DSP and don't want to break the bank, beeswax might be a good fit.",

      "body": "When you talk about fee transparency you have to consider a lot of different things. A DSP add extra revenue in a number of ways beyond just the DSP fee or the bids. Some of the more obvious examples would be adding a markup on tools, data and more that is offered in the platform. If you for example offer brand safety, audience data and other things then you can buy it for X CPM from those vendors and sell it for Y CPM with the difference being your margin. Or you might even buy it at a flat rate and sell it at a CPM to all your customers. A DSP could also get a lower CPM in from the SSP but sell at the same CPM as others (who get a higher CPM in). There could of course be a number of different ways revenue share is done between different companies in the ecosystem. Then you could have a number of other fees for anything from more advanced reporting data to support and more that is not clear when you sign up but once you need it down the road you find out. If the DSP is built on top of a white label platform they would in turn be paying a fee as well to another platform, like an indirect DSP fee.",
