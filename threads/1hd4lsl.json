We're talking hundreds of thousands!\nIf that's true, Applovin must clearly do attribution fraud.\n\nIf I had the opportunity, I'd short sell them. Easy bag of money to take. In fact, the situation is more confusing because these fraud rumours, while totally plausible, seem to come from activist funds that have shortsold AppLovin.",
