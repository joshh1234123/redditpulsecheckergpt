      "body": "This is something the publishers will have control over. DSPs do not overlay the icon, they need to be able to handle setting the opt-out cookie when users opt out though. At least for frameworks like the EDAA/YourOnlineChoices style integrations DSPs do. But these days most vendors use the IAB TCF. It passes consent information in the bid request so DSPs will know if a user has opted in to data storage by their platform. Consent will be collected by publishers not DSPs. So if a publisher for example runs an opt in for several data collecting vendors then all those will be approved in the TCF ecosystem.",
