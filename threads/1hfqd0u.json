The format changes even when it's the same manufacturer\n2- not all suppliers share the CTV-ID through open rtb, making it hard to effectively target audiences on CTV.\n\nThere's a reason why IP addresses are mostly used in CTV for targeting, but for how long? Walled-garden approach of CTV players makes it hard to use IP.\n\nIDFA vs IDFV is irrelevant in CTV, unless what you are referring to is Apple TV, and I'm not sure how Apple handle advertising there.",
