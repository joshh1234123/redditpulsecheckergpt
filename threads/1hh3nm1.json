Never works out well. \n\nDSP\nFacebook/meta\nGoogle Ads\n\nThing is with auto (which we do a TON of)- those budgets come and go, plus incentives may start mid-month, and co-op has restrictions.\n\nDM if you have questions, happy to help you get aligned. $15k is small budget to be honest, so you’re likely not going to hit campaign mins at simplifi or basis/centro unless you’re doing larger programmatic buys, which is counter intuitive for generating decent lead flow.",

There are tools which can unify most of the Google and social channels (Hubspot comes to mind) or most of the social stuff (Sprinklr) though the cost of these do not make much sense given the relatively low budget. The OTT piece makes it more of a challenge. Some of the DSPs would absolutely say they can do all of these things for you, but some portion of it is going to be as a managed service (or something with absurdly high minimums.)",
