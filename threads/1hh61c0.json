      "body": " Amazon DSP campaigns won't serve your ads on google search pages. Where \"on google\" do your ads show up? If you're talking about the shopping feed at the top of a search page where it shows your product and the page directs to [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com), you have no way to disable as Amazon is paying for that and not the advertiser (someone should confirm though): [https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/uxnykf/do\\_our\\_amazon\\_ads\\_spend\\_and\\_serve\\_on\\_google\\_search/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PPC/comments/uxnykf/do_our_amazon_ads_spend_and_serve_on_google_search/)\n\nAlso, the whole point of DSP is the offsite component. If you really only want to run on Amazon's ecosystem, I would just stick to Sponsored Product, Sponsored Display, and Sponsored Brand Video campaigns.",
