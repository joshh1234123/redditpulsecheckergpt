Never asked any questions about me as a person. At the start he said “thank you for coming” and then dived straight in with the interview questions.  That totally put me off in wanting to do well\n\nAnyway I didn’t get the job.  Good luck in sorting out your issue.  Hopefully anyone from Netflix ads can help",
