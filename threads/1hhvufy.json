The task lists, project timelines, and calendar features make it easy to keep track of tasks, deadlines, and creative changes all in one place. It’s been a great alternative to using multiple tools like Excel.",

It’s very helpful to look at my day in its totality to see where my time is already committed in meetings and then what I need to do with the time I have left. My last job also used Asana company wide, so I found the integration with Asana helpful to sync the too.",
