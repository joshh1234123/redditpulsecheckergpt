      "body": "It’s definitely a sector that can work well for programmatic if done right. Make sure to dig into data from their current lead generation PPC campaigns and GA data. There will be useful data there to inform your programmatic campaigns. For example look into the top smart bidding signals in Google Ads and see if they can help you get a head start with geo-targeting, time of day etc. Of course also look into current creatives to find current top performers. Consider A/B-testing of creatives. You can often get X multiples improvement from A/B-testing creatives by for example running multivariate tests. Use site inclusion lists. Try to find relevant publishers for the given audience. Don’t run with a blacklist and pre-bid filters like DV and IAS alone, you’ll get tons of bad traffic that way which will make your metrics a lot harder to achieve and many of those impressions and clicks will be garbage even if they are low cost (think advertising window replacements on a Hello Kitty game site however brand safe it might be). Go for quality traffic early on instead. \n\nWhen you start getting enough leads it will be on to work more with data analysis, ML tools and so forth to dig deeper.",
