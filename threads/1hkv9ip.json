      "body": "Hi I've worked in DOOH for years. Billboards generate vastly more impressions than any smaller place based screen, this is due to something called the Impression Multiplier. Billboard CPMs are generally lower than the place based CPMs, it sounds like the difference might be attributed to \n\n1. **The agency likely making/suggesting a direct booking**. 9m imps for $16k  = $1.78 CPM before any margin. This is very low. I'd have to phone in some favors to get a rate that low. \\~$3 CPM direct is low but possible. Programmatic CPMs, depending on the venue type you need, will vary from $5 CPM = $25+CPMs\n\n2. **A venue type difference**. Did you only use Billboards in your forecast? The numbers are so different it seems unlikely to be a comparison of like for like. Smaller screens = smaller impression numbers because of the multiplier. I think this partly explains your lower imp forecast.\n\n3. **Ad server vs DSP**. Digital billboards running in an ad server, vs being bought programmatically can deliver many more impressions. Billboard publishers tend to operate a 60s loop. 6 ads displayed for 10s each, then looping back to the start. In a publisher ad server they can control and prioritize direct bookings over the programmatic spot in that loop, similar to an online pub ad server. \n\nAssuming 1 publisher here and that they have the avails to run the direct booking more often, they will , maybe 2 or 3 spots in that loop. vs the programmatic spot still only getting 1 spot in the loop and then you needing to win that programmatic spot auction. \n\nTL:DR - Your CPMs are a bit high, theirs are very low. It sounds like a direct booking in an ad server, so not like for like. You could tell them you're better as you can add data, attribution, fancy reporting dashboards, maybe throw in measurement for free.\n\nBut if it's a question of who can come in with the lowest CPM, you can't compete with a direct booking and $1.78 CPM is the lowest CPM I've seen in a while",
