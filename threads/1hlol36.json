Or there are seasons for certain industries (mortgage, auto, travel) which may have spikes in spend.\n\nRate (price) varies directly with spend (demand).",

If you have a background in mathematics or data science or AI, then feel free to ask for more details from your partners. It's critical to understand that sampling is always used for forecasting, and that sampling goes beyond inventory sampling (it can also be related to cloud computing).",

      "body": "Ad revenue can definitely be unpredictable, especially if you’re relying on just a few ad networks..... it can actually amplify CPM swings since different networks have varying inventory volumes and demand. To smooth out those swings, some  devs or publishers whatever turn to ad mediation because it combines multiple networks and optimizes fill rates, which helps stabilize revenue and makes it more consistent overall.\n\nAs for forecasting, they generally work pretty well in standard conditions, and that link shared in the discussion on historical CPM trends is definitely useful. But it’s worth keeping in mind that forecasting accuracy heavily depends on the quality of your input data e.g. traffic volume, audience behavior, and seasonality. Even when trends are well-known (like January dips), their accuracy relies a lot on the stability of your user base. External factors like privacy policy changes (IDFA, for example) or unexpected market shifts can throw those predictions off. To manage these risks, I’d recommend not just relying on historical data but also running regular audits of your inventory and experimenting with new ad formats. For instance, trying out hybrid models (rewarded + native ads) or A/B testing different waterfalls can sometimes uncover unexpected opportunities for growth.",

So yeah, relying on them completely? Not the safest bet.......To minimize risk, a lot of publishers turn to mediation platforms or build custom setups. If you don’t want to deal with everything manually, I’d recommend checking out CAS.AI. They’ve got a strong programmatic stack with hybrid models (mediation + bidding) that optimize fill rates and eCPMs. Since they connect to a ton of ad networks, they fill gaps at the best price. Appodeal’s also worth testing, give it a shot.\n\nAs for managing cash flow, most publishers typically keep a reserve that covers 1-2 months of expenses, like marketing and dev costs. Some SSPs offer early payouts, but they usually take a cut for it. Credit lines? Less common, but it’s case-by-case. If it’s an option, definitely negotiate with your partners directly.",
