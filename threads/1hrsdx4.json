      "body": "I don't know of any good public programs that offer this sort of depth - most public training programs are essentially marketing disguised as training. \n\nTo be perfectly honest though, it feels like a lot of what you're describing actually just requires getting super curious and asking about of dumb questions in meetings.\n\nThe only way I've learned is by 1) working at a DSP and asking a million questions to the product people about these exact topics 2) getting out of my depth and getting corrected by experts 3) then wading into the deep waters via reading IAB standards etc...\n\nThe solutions engineers + product managers are generally the ones who know how stuff actually works and gets implemented, and what sort of duct tape is required to actually operate them. As for the dataset analysis + metrics, the data analysts who are helping set up reporting are useful in asking what kinds of metrics actually are relevant and what sorts of things are not.",

While on the openweb front there's not a ton of free resources for this, you can actually try to learn a lot of it from documentation of companies.\n\n- When I started in AdTech (as a PM without any coding knowledge), I found Google's documentation extremely helpful. In my opinion, the documentation in Google (DV etc.) is extremely technical and allows you to deeply understand intent and decision making.\n\n- I started on the supply side (and an exchange) and read the IAB protocol documentation for understanding OpenRTB. I read it, asked devs about stuff I didn't understand, and then re-read it. Helped me a ton! Same with Prebid.",

      "body": "Beyond reading everything you come across about the topics you mention I'd recommend meeting a lot of people from the industry. Do meetings with tech vendors and people from other companies in the industry. Visit trade shows (like Dmexco), network and meet (online or in person) people from different adtech companies. You'd be surprised how much knowledge you can get from a 1h meeting with an experienced 'sales' person from an adtech company if you ask a lot of questions. Many of the business execs or account managers have a lot of product knowledge about their specific areas. View or attend IAB webinars or seminars. Join IAB groups or task forces of different kinds (if you can), do the work, attend the meetings or calls, participate. You might end up in a room with some very skilled people if you are lucky that talks about stuff you can't read somewhere easily. \n\nThere's lots of technical documentation available as well to read or skim through. Say you for example would have had an interest in things like the privacy sandbox and data, there's tons of in depth information to read if you do some research. Like the the UK CMA reports (example https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6731ffb00d90eee304badaff/CMA\\_s\\_Q2\\_to\\_Q3\\_2024\\_report.pdf) or the various Github pages (like https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics or https://patcg.github.io/ppa-api/). Of course a lot of that and similar information is targeted to developers but can be worth to skim through for different topics. Or if you'd like to learn about a topic like cookie syncing and how Google handles it then their documentation has tons of info, like here: https://developers.google.com/authorized-buyers/rtb/cookie-guide",
