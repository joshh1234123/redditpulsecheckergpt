It’s just been hard for me to find a fully-remote position since so many companies are transitioning to partial in-office at some capacity. In my current position I’m clocking in maybe 3 hours of consistent work a day, so it would be really nice to have a second prog job with similar low workload.\n\nAre both jobs starting around the same time or have you already been employed at J1 and then adding on a J2? If you already know the workload of J1 and think it sounds like you could handle J2, then go for it. It doesn’t hurt to try.",
