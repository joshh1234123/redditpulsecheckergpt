So, while they may be able to get 95% of the same work accomplished with just one DSP, there could be exclusive options only available in one DSP and not the others.\n\nTTD, for example, allows for better cross-device CTV tracking and targeting compared to DV360, but DV360 offers YouTube buying capabilities not available anywhere else. Yahoo DSP might have first-party audiences that aren't available outside Yahoo's walled garden, and Criteo might be useful for contextual targeting or retail media.\n\nAll this to say that it's not uncommon for programmatic buyers to use more than one DSP.",

They all \"claim\" that they have slightly better products, but realistically, it breaks out to cost and tech. I honestly do think it's a complete waste to be working with 4. There is no learnings being fed from each dsp. For example, if you're running ctv through TTD but display through Yahoo, if you were using TTD only you could map out conversions via cross device and see if someone had seen a ctv ad before a display and measure the uplift. \n\nAlso; Google is one of the only companies to have exact match tech when it comes to cross device so the comment about Google being mediocre when it comes to ctv isn't entirely accurate.\n\nThe way that everyone is mapping out CTV now is through phones and I guarantee you're logged into a Google product through your phone and your tv (via YouTube)",

As far as I'm aware, TTD does leverage IP address targeting across channels, but I imagine UID 2.0 adoption rates across the big publishers also helps them better identify users.\n\nThis may come as a surprise to most people, but Google is actually one of the leaders in terms of user privacy, at least in terms of what type of targeting is readily available to advertisers.",

      "body": "Agree with the above fully about first price auctions. You can make a chart and compare your CPM for the same inventory across multiple DSPs as well to see sometimes big differences. They don’t all have the same fee structure and the bid the publisher see is different even if you place the same CPM bid in all the DSPs.\n\nAlso add that a lot of buyers place fixed bids at fairly even CPMs. For example 1, 2, 5, 10 etc levels. In the win reports this will be clear as big fat horizontal lines in the chart at integer and popular levels where a lot of the wins take place near those numbers. \n\nSo as an example maybe a lot of people bid at 5 USD CPM max in their DSP but not as many at 5.05 USD CPM, then at 6 comes a new bunch. Etc. Of course if they use an algo and dynamic CPM the case would be different but when a campaign manager enters their max CPM during setup many of them enter some integer and some of them more common than others. For sure a max CPM of say 2 USD is much, much more common among buyers and their configs than a 2.2 USD one.",
