I'm actually about to launch something for free myself based on my experiences.\nTTD edge academy is quite popular for programmatic fundamentals.\nWorth looking at other DSP certification/module platforms e.g. Amazon, Adform and Yahoo all have some but some require access to the platform first.",

      "body": "Man, I feel you—navigating the wild world of programmatic advertising with limited DV360 access can be daunting, especially when stuck in the Meta and Google Ads lane! I’ve been there, hunting for the right resources. You can level up by diving into platforms like Trade Desk's Edge Academy and Google Skillshop to get the theory down. Also, StackAdapt and Teads offer robust self-serve platforms for learning the ropes without breaking the bank on hefty DSPs. [Pulse.ai](http://Pulse.ai) too is a great resource to explore programmatic advertising tools and insights. Learning on these will definitely give a head start!",
