Others simply wanna see it as a box ticked on their mediaplans because an OMP only media plan can't be good. Then there's agency and/or client specific commercial agreements/benefits to run more PMPs etc. \n\nIn general I think they're good and able to add value, it's simply a matter of knowing why you're planning them and ensuring you get what you ultimately pay a premium for",

While you do get the publisher(s) you want, AI bots and other bots will for example be more than happy to scrape a big premium site for content to read/process/harvest and they don't care if that impression they generate while scraping will be sold through direct, PMP or open auction.

Without a large client/s, the curation part is a crap shoot. Lower cpm for what I’m buying anyway is a win win for everyone. Avoid doing actual commits though.
