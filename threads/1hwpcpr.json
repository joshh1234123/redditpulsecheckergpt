There are some great platforms out there.\n\nMake sure you ask them about supply path and how they source their CTV inventory, open exchange CTV is no beuno.\n\nFocus on platforms that have:\n\n1.

What kind of attribution can they provide, and how are they getting it.\n\nGoodluck, happy to help make intros as well.",
