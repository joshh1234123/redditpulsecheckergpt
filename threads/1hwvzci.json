      "body": "Interview questions were pretty basic tbh except for the case study round which was extensive and took me a week to do.\n\nIt’s a bit early for me to say about work culture. But comparing it to other bigger agencies so far I’ll say this:\n\nPros\n- Less internal politics because your manager will be in the US. So people seem more friendly and collaborative (to me)\n- It seems they’re getting accounts from Omnicom media after the merger so it seems they’re expanding here\n- ⁠Pay is substantially more than non retail agencies and my immediate managers seem friendly and supportive so far.\n\nCons:\n1) A bit more disorganized compared to what you’ll see in other big agencies (IPG, Publicist or GroupM). Some processes are flywheel and the others are Omnicom so it can be a bit confusing on things.\n\n2) I personally think upward mobility here is really limited because there is one senior manager under whom there are 10-15 managers. So it might be difficult to move up the corporate ladder here. I also heard this from an ex employee here.⁠\n\n3) You will be limited to just certain DSPs. For example I’m on Walmart team so I only have run campaigns on Walmart and TradeDesk. If you’re on the Amazon team you’ll only be running programmatic campaigns on Amazon. So yeah that’s a con I think.",
