      "body": "Interesting, I’ve never heard of the ‘big six’ - what’s included there? I’ve heard of the big four (soon to be the big three - OMG/IPG, WPP, Publicis).\n\nPros: there’s no better place to learn programmatic \n\nCons: the WILD unpredictability - first, there’s no real way to tell going in how stressful an account is going to be/how your WLB is going to look. I said this in another post but everything is very account specific, not even agency specific. I had one agency job before moving to an in-house programmatic team and got unbelievably lucky - I was on the most established, biggest account at my agency (which is one of the most well known ones among the ‘big four’). Someone else noted in another post that you should also ask how long the agency has had the account - a new account is likely going to be very stressful.\n\nThe pay is also an obvious con but I think that’s not unique to any one agency role, just being agency side specifically.",

      "body": "Never heard the phrase \"big six\" before.  Dentsu is a distant 5th. If the IPG+Omnicom merger goes through, they'll slide into an even more distant 4th.  My question is: who is the 6th?\n\nIn answer to your question, here's my take:\n\nPros: tons of experience and networking to be gained. You'll get exposure to more of the business in a big agency, so as long as you network you'll gain a ton of knowledge and experience.\n\nCons: depending on the engagement, the client is often paying a 60 or even 75% markup for your service. For example, an analytics manager can earn $150-175k because the client is paying $600k as a part of a larger contract.  Larger companies have been building their own internal agencies for this reason. They can give you a pay raise, you'd only have one client, and they're saving a ton of money.\n\nWhy is that a con? The agency model is starting to decline. When big clients leave, jobs quickly disappear, moreso than ever.  It's part of the impetus for the IPG+Omnicom merger.",

It’s definitely a term used (PubMatic just used the term in a press release the other day), but because of the gap in billings between 4th and 5th, no one thinks beyond the 4 hold cos.\n\nPros: lots of great individuals who can teach you the ropes of programmatic; access to all the tools of the trade; easy to stay on top of new tech because the vendors are beating down your door.\n\nCons: politics; nearly impossible to navigate the career ladder; terrible hours and poor expectation setting.\n\nI would switch every couple of years - basically job hopping for your promotion.  Counting on your managers and your work to get you promoted at a hold co is futile, and you’ll always get passed up.",

      "body": "Agencies are promoting more internally (and faster) rather external hires due to economic uncertainty. Slower hiring during the pandemic years has left gaps at management levels and I’m seeing specialists/traders move into management roles a lot faster than before. Offshoring has had a massive impact also. Be the squeaky wheel + demonstrate value and you’ll move up quickly. At 2 years exp - start preparing yourself for the next level and start showing leadership skills. At 2.5-3 years exp you should actively pursue manager roles. Programmatic in Holding co’s is kinda like joining the navy seals, you need to embrace the pain and only the strong will survive. No sugar coating here, it will be a grind no matter where you go and it’s not for everyone. But if you love your craft there’s truly no other place like it.",
