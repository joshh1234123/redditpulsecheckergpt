      "body": "You can not get PII data (such as IP address) in any report. You can see impression and conversion timestamp data within a path to conversion and conversion details report. OS data and site level data can be pulled into a basic performance report, but be weary of how much data you’re fetching as anything > 1mm rows will break the data pull. \n\nIf you want impression log data, you’ll need to ask your rep for REDS data. It’s not something you can get off the shelf from their reporting suite.",

That will tell you, directionally, your audience size and forecasted scale depending on the CPM, f/cap, geo, inventory, etc you provide. \n\nThe tool is not totally accurate, but neither are most forecasting tools. But that should give you some idea. \n\nFor conversion data, you would choose too which x-device graph you wanna use. But you can also do duplicates of the same conversion event measured with a different graph, which will allow you to see conversion counts at the person, HH, or no-graph level.",
