My experience is limited & I get few opportunities to run Programmatic campaigns at the agency I work at so I have been hoping to save some time/testing. Recently I have shifted to Contextual & Browsing audiences & also LAL from engaged users & 3P budget has been reduced substantially & often getting paused mid-flight in favor of the others.",

Even if they are somewhat quality, you need to understand how they are syncing their data with the DSP / SSP in order to understand if its actually useful or not.\n\nBetter nowadays to go direct to publisher with some 2PD / PMP style buys or start to leverage Privacy Enhancing Technologies like Data Clean Rooms to work with publishers / strong 1PD (this is effectively what Google PAIR is an example of or what the likes of InfoSum have been doing for many years).",

This isn't campaign specific so just asking for gen knowledge but if there aren't \"brand\" names in audience providers that give off that base level of quality, how do you choose when comparing in platform?\n\nIs it just a toss up, test and learn type deal?",

From what I'm gathering, LAL through the platform algo's are some of the lowest performing tactics so I'm curious how buyers are modeling out their seed data or working with data partners to do so, to avoid relying on the platform levers themselves",

Although what they can do is a bit limited. \n\n  \nDitto to what stevenchoi said above, a lot of data is niche, can be hard to find etc. Example: [https://adara.com/](https://adara.com/) has some of the best data I have used for targeting people who live US wide but want to go to Vegas during the month of June. But, they removed their data from TTD so you now need to reach out to them to get data, and you have to meet minimum spends. Now I have to go with more \"wider\" data that just says they want to travel. Much less helpful, and now I have to experiment.",

And then you have the more traditional advertiser approach which data vendors could take, such as a Customer Match style solution or via a Data Clean Room.",
