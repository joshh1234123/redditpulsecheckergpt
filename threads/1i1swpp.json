      "body": "\"Kickback\" or \"rebate\" are technically illegal in US, many other countries.  Any contractual agreements which enable a vendor agency to receive discount / kickback / rebate are supposed to be fully disclosed to all clients.\n\n  \nObviously this does not happen.\n\nModern verbiage in programmatic seems to be \"Take-Rate Discount,\" usually structured that as your spend increases, your agency TRD increases.  Since a \"Discount\" it's not a kickback or rebate, and thus not legally obligated to disclose.\n\nTRD now so common they factor into almost any scaled or complex deal structure",
