      "body": "IMO (to try and be helpful) UGC is generally lower down the totem pole of content that advertisers want to be associated with 1 outside of YouTube. \n\nThe main reason is that it’s not always premium full episodic content produced by a studio - which there happens to be billions of impressions available an hour with that tier of content. Typically UGC can slide into OLV budgets but again, people will narrow the targeting, have layers of protection applied and try to follow the well lit streets as much as possible. \n\nI hope this helps. \n\nIf you want to increase your win rate lower your CPMs and start trying to sell the value of your content directly with integration deals.",
