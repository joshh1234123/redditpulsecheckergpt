What kind of IDs do you have that you're looking to build with?\n\nAt the most basic it's just table joins leveraging datasets that have linkages between different ID types: cookie + IP, cookie + HEM, MAID + IP, MAID + HEM, postal + HEM, etc.\n\nSome players will license their graph as full installs, others treat it more like a data append where you send your list in and get a deliverable back out.\n\nDifferentiators are O&O exclusive data and then the performance of their data science in filtering out noisy linkages (the coffee shop wifi is the evergreen example) and getting an appropriate balance between precision and scale.\n\nDM me if you want to dig in; I'm not in Sales, I just enjoy the subject",
