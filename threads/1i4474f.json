Performance is encouraging as long as your measurement isn't skewed to a legacy cookie based approach.\nSetup is probably the biggest challenge, it can be like running 20 PMPs in a single LI.",

      "body": "Its predominately a targeting solution. So yes measurement is dependent on what you normally do. You can be a bit smarter by leveraging the data clean room aspect separately but its rare to see from a standard agency / advertiser.  \nIt does remind me of when contextual vendors try to emphasis how it works from a targeting perspective without reliance on legacy identifiers, but then end up showing KPIs that are 1) meaningless (CTR / Viewability) or 2) a CPA using, you guessed it, a cookie or device ID. Major facepalm.",

Since DV360 doesn’t have closed loop sales attribution on third party inventory (you can do it via ADH for Google inventory) and doesn’t share log level data, you could consider this an upgrade.",
