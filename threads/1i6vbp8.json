      "body": "It’s very rare to receive a substantial raise for the same role, regardless of everything costing more than it did 4 years ago. For the most part, you’ll get a cost of living raise of 3% without a promotion. You can go to your boss with a job offer and ask them to match it, but they usually won’t and you’ve kind of put a target on your head as someone who wants to leave the company\n\nHaving said that, you’ve been in ad tech for what 2.5 years? You’re getting pretty well compensated at $93k for that level of experience, and that’s pretty in line with salaries across companies at that experience level. \n\nTruth of the matter is you really need to find a new role after a few years in order to receive substantially more money. It’s just the way it is now",
