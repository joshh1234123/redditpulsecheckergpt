If your e-team needs new tech partnerships, that’s fine, but the KPIs, comp structures are vastly different than bringing in new clients / ad dollars which is traditional BD.\n\nKeep in mind tech partners will be selling you to use their tech, which is the opposite of trying to sell your agency to clients. You need to sign tech partners that fill a void in your current stack, inventory, analytics, CTV, data, etc.",
