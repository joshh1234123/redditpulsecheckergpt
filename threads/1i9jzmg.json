      "body": "Thanks everyone. I completely agree in the main. Not all gaming traffic is equal which is why I didn’t want to lead your responses. Quality of game access is fundamental to really connect. \n\nAs programmatic people though do you look at the audience over the past time? E.g. if you were buying 18-34 ads for an awareness campaign with IAB formats (display/ video/ vertical video) would gaming matter vs browsing the open internet if the performance was there or attention. Like, does the activity matter when it comes to connecting with right people?",
