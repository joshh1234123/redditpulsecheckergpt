If you need a line or a walkthrough of options, I'd be happy to connect you with someone at Place Exchange.\n\nThere are some airport media owners shifting a lot to direct, however, such as United this year. So it could also be good to reach out for direct buys if you have a very specific preference of inventory or possible restrictions.",

Also, some airports, like Las Vegas are specific to one direct relationship (lamar in the case of LAS) so you need to buy some direct.  Also, check out Anuvu and IMM, as they may have solutions. good luck!",
