In simplest terms, CM360 is just an ad server. it’s a home for your creatives that can track impressions across multiple sources (or just a single source).\n\n  \nThere’s nothing inherently wrong with hosting your creatives directly in DV360 if you don’t rely on CM360 for reporting, dashboards, or whatever else.",

It's a self-sufficient platform, you don't need to rely on CM360 in order for DV360 to fully function.\n\nCM360 gives better insight into floodlight activity and cross-channel conversions/touchpoints, but if you're only using DV360 then you're all good.",
