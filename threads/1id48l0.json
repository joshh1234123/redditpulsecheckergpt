AU data is expensive, because it requires eye tracking sample based on panels (like real people), that's why only large enterprise advertisers and big agencies can afford tools like Adelaide and DV/IAS (although these legacy players aren't there yet). I have my reservation about the current state of AU but it's a separate topic. But anyway, my tool probably isn't for you man.\n\nI'm building something that is a) good enough to be a starting place to analyze your own DSP site report and b) simple enough that I can provide for free, which I think most smaller advertisers and indi agencies would appreciate -- but the only way to find out is put it out there and see if people throw eggs at me ;)",
