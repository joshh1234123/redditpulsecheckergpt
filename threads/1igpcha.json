I have tried putting macro like this: \n\n<iframe src=\"serverlink?click=${CLICK\\_URL}\" style=\"width:300px;height:600px;margin:0;padding:0;border:none;overflow:hidden;box-sizing:border-box;\"></iframe>\n\nBut the problem is that the link inside iFrame leads to my server with creative (its not a link to landing Page). Link to the Landing Page is a part of my hosted creative, so the click happens inside iFrame on my server.",
