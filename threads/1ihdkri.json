      "body": "The standard rate without any tiering or margin for DV360 is 15% for exchange buying and 4% for PG / YT.\nDepending on the reseller and/or their global footprint, both those rates come down for what they can get but they can markup by a set % accordingly to make their fees. Then you introduce the monthly minimums that some may charge, it's a money making machine.",

      "body": "I’m guessing your seat is at the partner level, and the 19% all-in rate applies to exchange, while non-exchange (YT and PG) might be lower. We had a similar request but with support, and our Google partner rep told us they can offer better rates if we hit some spend thresholds. If I remember correctly they also had a competitive self-serve tier with minimal support and no minimums. This was a couple years back so I’m assuming the rates could be more competitive now. Let me know you want an intro and I can refer our rep",

Their responsive ads, AI implementation, and aggressive tech training is 100% about monetizing low quality search inventory and a bot-ridden display network. \n\nI hope these new AI companies give them a run for their money.",

It's laughable how bad the MFA issue is. Every platform has its strengths and weaknesses so it's good that you are open to testing others. DM me if you want to chat more.",
