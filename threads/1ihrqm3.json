      "body": "Why be concerned about daily spend? Give it a monthly allocation and let the platform manage pacing. It's alright and totally normal to have higher spend days and lower spend days. \n\nDaily spend goals (imo) are trash, because if you're at threat of coming in under then the platform is going to start gobbling up cheap inventory and maxing out f/caps. If you're at threat of going over with 6 hours left in the day, then the daily flight kind of just peters out when maybe 8pm ends up being a prime time for exposure. \n\nAs for frequency, is it actually changing per user (on avg) or are you just reaching more people during these spiked periods? \n\nMaybe I take a liberal approach to it, but I wouldn't worry about this unless it's blowing up CPMs and you're trying to adhere to an impression goal (or CPM goal).",
