My initial thought is that I would always prefer to directly hire a contractor because there’s control over communication and skill level. Oftentimes contractors are getting access to agency internal platforms, documents, chats, etc etc.  so there’s a certain level of trust (or NDAs) involved. \n\nMy other thought is that many contractors are hooked up with their gigs in a similar fashion as this service you’re offering— except in a more informal way. The fixer maintains a small network of vetted contractors and connects them to agencies they are in contact with when help is needed. From there it’s hands off and up to the contractor. \n\nNot ragging on your startup whatsoever, just giving my stream of thoughts.",

      "body": "Great points, and I really appreciate your insights!\n\nAt the moment, I handle execution myself, but as demand grows, I plan to build a vetted team—not an open marketplace, but a small, experienced group of traders who follow standardized processes. The idea is to offer agencies consistency & expertise without them needing to go through the process of hiring, onboarding, and vetting contractors individually.\n\nYou’re 100% right that direct contractor relationships work well for some agencies, especially when trust is established. The challenge I’ve seen is that some agencies struggle to find reliable, experienced contractors when they need them, or they over-hire full-time staff for tasks that fluctuate in workload.\n\nProgrammatic Pilot is meant to fill that gap—a structured, scalable way for agencies to get expert campaign execution when needed, without long-term hiring.\n\nAgain, thanks for the feedback!",
