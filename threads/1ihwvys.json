      "body": "If you're unsure on what features are driving up your TTD invoices have you tried pulling the various reports which can help you better understand where your media budgets are going? TTD literally has the fee feature reports, data-elements reports etc. templatized and ready to download in the UI. From there it's very easy to cross-check your invoices and the various elements which contribute to those costs.\n\nIf you then figure out you've been figuring out you've been paying a substantial amount for something you may have not wanted to use, nor were aware was auto-enabled then that would be a different thread ;)",
