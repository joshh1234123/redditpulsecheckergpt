For example, $100 daily budget could be very small depending on what your target market is and the audience(s) you're utilizing. \n\nGeneral best practice, I'd never increase your daily budget by 50% if you've only seen 1 sale. Try and have at least a few consistent sales over the course of 1-2 week(s) before making those types of changes. If your budget is not fully utilized try and do minimal increases to your bid strategy and see what that does for both delivery and performance.",

My bet for better advice is on the PPC subreddit cause this sub is more focused on campaigns ran on a CPM basis.\n\nAs posty said, you need to share with us more details about your targeting and set up for us to really know how to help. Based on what you provided, you probably need to raise your CPC bids and hone in on your keyword strategy since you aren't generating a lot of clicks/sales",
