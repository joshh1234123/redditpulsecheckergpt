It’s part of Omnicom, which, after the IPG merger, will be the largest agency in the world. This will be a great learning opportunity early in your career and will open doors for future growth.\n\nThat said, depending on the team, Omnicom can have a fast-paced, demanding culture, but you’ll gain valuable experience and build a strong network of industry connections. It’s worth it at this stage of your career—though I wouldn’t necessarily make the same recommendation if you had more experience.",

If it happens a few times that might be fine and there are of course all sorts of reasons including ones beyond your control. But be careful not to build a CV where you leave every employer after 1-2 years or less and go to the next. If you were building a team, would you like to hire someone who would likely leave soon?",

This company has “invested” in you this year, but they could make your job redundant just as easily next year. Look after your own interests.\n\nGood luck!",
