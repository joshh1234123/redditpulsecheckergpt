It's unfilled for various reasons—it might be a tier 2 or tier 3 impression where only a few bid. But \"few\" doesn't mean no one wants it. There could be direct buyers targeting that specific tier 2 or tier 3 traffic or a networks offering 100% fill rates. That is what he want to find here, so I really don't know where the 'free money' from you come from?",

Someone saying \"fill my impressions\" without describing what I would be buying is asking for free money haha\n\nI think people often forget adspots are an elastic product regarding both price and audience. People on the supply side seldom put the effort in to actually find a buyer for their audience. They jack themselves up on header bidding and bot traffic and then complain when us buyers laugh them out the building.\n\n@OP - if you really want to make money, go find a real buyer and then fill rate won't matter, because you'll be making money. Also, do video too",
