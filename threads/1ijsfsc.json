For CTV, since there are no \"clicks\" the conversions are likely VTC so it depends on when/how the landing page was loaded and how the conversion pixels are called. \n\nI have seen Rampant gaming of view-through conversions - [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rampant-gaming-view-through-conversions-dr-augustine-fou-6yede](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/rampant-gaming-view-through-conversions-dr-augustine-fou-6yede)  and what you are observing may be a correction to it.",

Obviously, there are a disporportionate # of conversions from online videos, but we were seeing many from CTV before stats dropped like a rock.\n\nThe recent change for us is likely due to what u/AugustineFou mentions. I assume many were \"false\" conversions, but I still thought it gave us some input on value of our audience targeting.",

I've never heard great things about the quality of 3rd party audience data, so I was hoping Google audience targeting would prove worthwhile.\n\nYour work looks amazing btw! I'm looking forward to reading more of your articles.",
