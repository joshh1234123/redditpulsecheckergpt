      "body": "This is all my personal opinion, coming from a guy who has found financial success in this industry. \n\nDo I think success in programmatic requires this mindset? No. Do I think that overall success in the ad industry requires this mindset? Absolutely yes. \n\nI’ve worked with so many programmatic buyers who do the bare minimum. But worse than that, even “good” programmatic buyers are so often unhelpful when it comes to solving a problem. \n\nFor example, “client wants to do X, Y, and Z programmatically. Is this possible, can we make that happen?” \n\nThe response from the buyer: “no that’s not possible” \n\n??? Okay, you were given a problem and you didn’t do anything to help solve it. In fact, you made the situation worse. \n\nPoint being, few people go far out of their way to actually be the person who solves problems. Even if it’s technically out of your wheelhouse. \n\nBe the person who provides immense value to your organization. Typically this means taking your programmatic expertise and growing into a more strategic or client-facing role. \n\nI could go on and on about this. But to answer your question, what type of commitment will it take to be the person who:\n\n1) is the go-to person when you need help or answers \n\n2) provides high value to the org",

      "body": "You're viewing this way too black and white. \n\nFirst- what do you mean by \"succeed\"? Be a good top exec at a major ad tech or buying agency? Make a bunch of money? Be an industry figure head?\n\nSecond - what does \"all-in\" mean? Work all day/night with no social life? Give up weekends?\n\nIf you define success in the extreme, then yes it'll take extreme work to get there. If you define success reasonably, then it'll take reasonable work to get there.\n\nIn my experience, and most of my colleagues, I've found the first few years are a bit grueling. A lot of evenings working until 7-8pm, occasionally later. Never really feeling \"off the clock\". Helping on new biz etc that sometimes brought me in on the weekends, etc.\n\nOver time, there are ways to get away from that and still have a reasonably successful career if you want it (e.g., mid/low 6 figures, decent W/L balance, get invited to conferences).\n\n\nIt's just trade offs. Best W/L balance comes from client side, best pay from tech/vendors, best industry engagement from agencies. Pick what mixture of success you want and align your career and work life to that.",

But make sure you are learning new things.\n\nTo get beyond the average in programmatic and adtech you should build a network of connections, people from the industry you can reach out to when you need help or ideas. Too many people are limited to working with what’s presented to them in the platform they use. Don’t settle for that.\n\nThen expand into new areas. Learn statistics, data science. Learn to export raw impression level data and import it to a machine learning platform. Learn to do regression analysis. Learn new skills. Don’t settle for a 3 day course. Go deeper.\n\nI like the good old saying: If you read three books on a subject you know more than 95% of the population about it.",

      "body": "No, sacrifice is not needed. There's people in this industry who lead programmatic teams who have never been hands-on in a platform. These people can or can not be effective at their job. Regardless, what will take you a lot further is communication. If you can take the complexities of programmatic/digital and simplify for others, that alone will set you apart from the group. Also, we are very much a people based industry, so stepping up your social game is also important (networking, events). Hope that helps.",

      "body": "Extreme sacrifice only makes sense when extreme success is possible as a result. Most people do just enough because there’s no massive reward at the end.\n\nThe definition of \"extreme\" is subjective, and in my view, programmatic advertising isn't a high-value skill with limitless earning potential. Think of it like this: if someone dedicates their life to becoming the best chess grandmaster and another person does the same for winning a tennis Grand Slam, who will make more money? No matter how hard you work, every industry has a ceiling on success and income. Programmatic advertising has a ceiling too you can't break it with sheer effort alone.\n\nThat's why it makes more sense to give about 80% effort. Beyond that, the marginal return on extra sacrifice and hard work is low. If you really want to make a killing in this industry, grinding like a donkey won’t cut it you need to work smart. Automate, build efficient workflows, and leverage tech.\n\nYes, hard work is necessary, but it has to come with the right kind of reward. Imagine if winning a tennis Grand Slam didn’t pay well and had no sponsors would we still see top-tier players? Probably not. Rewards drive people. For younger individuals, it's all about big wins. For older professionals, it's more about avoiding losses money, reputation, or status.",

      "body": "I think understanding integrated media plans, and how programmatic can help augment them is a key skill to learn. You don't have to give up your life to learn this; sometimes sitting in on a few extra meetings, asking questions from strategy folks, and trying to gain a broader perspective will be enough. Long hours are required sometimes, but if you're pulling more than 1-2 late nights a year, you have to wonder if the problems are due to capacity/staffing. You don't need to know how to build a media plan like you're on the strategy team, but you do need to know how to fill in the gaps/maximize the impact of the campaign with programmatic tactics. Because programmatic can help with a lot of different types of campaigns and run across many channels, this skill is very important. If you are client-facing, this understanding becomes key in helping them understand how/why programmatic is an important part of digital media plans.  It's very easy to think the areas you've seen success previously are the only ones worth pursuing, which isn't often the case.",

It’s different if you’re working into the night on a client pitch deck or something or take one for the team by working in a small group on a deck over the weekend. (This is still bad agency practice, but it’s reality). \n\nNo (good) employer wants their employees working that long— it just highlights that someone somewhere is fucking up with workload or prioritization. \n\nWhen I see employees leaving comments in decks or sending emails at 1am, I don’t think they’re a rockstar and I certainly don’t give them kudos. \n\nBe the person someone needs to call when they have a question. Be fast and great. Own your mistakes, and own your team’s mistakes. Be proactive about how to make more money for your org. Give extra information when questions are asked, always include a recommendation or solution. \n\nThese are the “extremes” you should focus on, not the amount of extra hours.",
