The panellists are of high profile, presentations are in most cases technical, and there are debates where people disagree rather than parroting each other.\n\n\nThey're also good for networking.\n\n\nAnd no, there are no parties in those, but apparently wild parties are needed for certain companies to sell (or to buy).",
