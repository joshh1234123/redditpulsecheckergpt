      "body": "I went from agency > adtech > in-house advertiser all programmatic. Still at the same company, I now manage all retail media (both onsite and offsite) and gave the national programmatic to a successor. So don’t think that if you go in-house to another company you’re stuck in just 1 lane. Your programmatic skills transfer very easily. \n\nIf you want to get out of advertising completely, you have valuable skills from a manager perspective that could translate well to a customer success team in a SaaS company or something.",

      "body": "Yeah the thing is that I see that in-house companies where I live mainly hire for performance marketing managers and want experience in all kinds of paid medias. I know myself that it is super easy to gain extra skills with a programmatic skillset, in the end of the day principals are similar. But when I start checking who went for those roles it is often people with previous experience in-house accross a wide range of paid medias which I don’t have. To be honest, I don’t mind changing from programmatic and I definetely like leading people (and I think I do that well). Somehow I always feel like everyone wants experience in a particular thing before you can lead anyone :D But perhaps I should just start bravely applying… need to check customer success and Saas. Thanks for an idea:)",
