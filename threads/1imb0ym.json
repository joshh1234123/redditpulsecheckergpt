      "body": "**We buy traffic through platforms like Meta (Facebook Ads) and resell that traffic by monetizing with ads from Google Ad Manager (GAM).**\n\nLately, we have been facing some challenges that directly affect the viability and profitability of this model:\n\n1. **Fluctuation in Meta (Facebook Ads) costs**\n   * The cost per click (CPC) and cost per thousand impressions (CPM) in Meta campaigns have been fluctuating significantly. These variations seem quite \"random,\" as they are large fluctuations—one day, the campaign has an 80% ROI, and the next day, the same campaign is at -40%. This did not happen before **December 20**.\n   * This makes ROI predictability difficult, as depending on the cost of traffic on a given day, the profit can be higher or lower.\n   * Some campaigns that were highly profitable have seen much lower margins due to these fluctuations.\n2. **Drop in Google Ad Manager (GAM) eCPM**\n   * eCPM (effective cost per thousand impressions) is one of the key factors that determine our ad revenue.\n   * Recently, we have noticed a sharp drop in eCPM, meaning we are earning less money for every thousand impressions served.\n3. **Increase in unfilled ad impressions (lower fill rate)**\n   * The fill rate represents the percentage of ad requests that successfully serve an ad.\n   * When this rate drops, it means more impressions go unfilled, directly reducing monetization.\n\n**Market Conversations**  \nBeyond our own analysis, we have been speaking with **other market players**, and they are all reporting the **same difficulties**. The situation appears to be widespread, with **several publishers facing similar challenges**. Additionally, **ADXs themselves have also reported difficulties** in their operations, indicating that the drop in performance is not an isolated case but rather a broader shift in the ecosystem.",

      "body": "There’s likely a lot to explore, and I assume you’ve already considered many aspects. Some of my comments may not be relevant or already explored, so feel free to point out anything that has already been investigated.\n\nFor both Meta and GAM, I see a few “grey hat” techniques that might be worth considering, but it’s probably too early since we haven’t established a clear diagnosis yet.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some key assumptions and additional questions:\n\n**Assumptions & Questions**\n\n**Assumption 1**\n\nYour arbitrage setup yields an average margin of less than 10% per impression, meaning that any fluctuation directly impacts profitability.\n\n**Assumption 2**\n\nYou're using a two-click setup, where traffic is first redirected to an intermediary page before landing on the final page where GAM monetizes.\n\n**Questions**\n\n* Are you primarily driving traffic on mobile or desktop? (Just checking if recent iOS updates could be a contributing factor.)\n* Regarding the Meta CPC and GAM eCPM anomalies, how granular was your analysis? Do these discrepancies appear across all reporting dimensions—even when cross-analyzing two, three, or more layers? Or are there specific segments where inefficiencies are more pronounced?\n\n**Comments on the GAM Side**\n\n* This might seem obvious, but seasonality impacts GAM eCPMs, which are generally lower in January and February.\n* More broadly, many publishers and media owners have reported a particularly slow start this year compared to 2024.\n* On a more specific note, GAM has been known to adjust monetization rules based on traffic quality and landing page performance. These changes are difficult to detect, and in many cases, we only find out months later—sometimes only through insider info.\n\n**Comments on the Meta Side**\n\n* I’ve seen similar fluctuations before—always-on campaigns can experience temporary anomalies, but they tend to stabilize over time.\n* Recently, Meta has dealt with aggressive “borderline” advertisers spending massive amounts at very low CPMs. Most of them have been banned, but some have repeatedly tried to re-enter the network. Knowing their time was limited, they took an extremely aggressive approach, which may have temporarily inflated CPM competition. While the peak occurred in December, some remnants of this behavior still persist.\n* Another possibility—sometimes an arbitrage niche simply gets discovered by other arbitragers, increasing competition. I’ve seen this happen repeatedly.\n\n**Other Key Factors**\n\n* Arbitrage setups always face discrepancies in reported user data across platforms. Meta might report X, Google Analytics Y, and so on. Have you noticed any shifts in these discrepancies that could offer additional clues?",

      "body": "**Potential Actions – GAM**\n\n* Have you tested another SSP to compare results? If the issue is specific to GAM, that would be a valuable insight.\n* Have you tried securing a DSP seat (e.g., DV360) to buy your own inventory? This would allow you to analyze how it appears in a DSP and check if any quality indicators (e.g., Active View) are being downgraded.\n* Any specific setup details in GAM we should be aware of? Have you at least temporarily raised floors to prevent monetizing at unprofitable CPMs?\n\n**Potential Actions – Meta**\n\n* Like GAM, Meta frequently adjusts its auction model, especially during high-activity periods. These updates are rarely disclosed in real-time, and we usually learn about them months later through insider sources.\n* Meta also increases costs when campaigns repeatedly hit the same audience segments to mitigate ad fatigue and prevent poor user experience.\n* Meta has an internal ad quality rating—some ad creatives and their associated metrics can eventually be flagged as underperforming. When this happens, auctions become biased against them, leading to increased CPMs.\n* Have you tried recreating the campaign? Since Meta’s optimization algorithms converge over time and may not adapt dynamically to changing conditions, a fresh campaign with new data could improve results.\n* It seems like your setup gives Meta’s optimization engine a lot of freedom. Have you enforced strict thresholds for CPA, ROAS, bid CPM, or any other key metric? Setting tighter constraints might reduce traffic volume but would help maintain profitability.\n\n ",
