You can use that information to find all the unique IDs for the cities in NL you'd need to target and use SDF files to update the geo-targeting of all your line items that require said geo-targeting. It's maybe more time-consuming the 1st time around but does help to have that information saved centrally in case something ever goes wrong duplicating IOs/LIs that didn't have that targeting",

Build your postcode table using that exact same format keep the also the other geographic information such as the cityname & country. Get the same list from google documentation & cross check them. Eliminate any location that has a mismatch between your file & the google one to avoid any wrong targeting that would end up in a different region or even country !\n\nSet-up the postcode in the SDF file & then submit it to update your campaign.",
