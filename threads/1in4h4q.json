Ran campaigns on CTV, DooH, Device ID, geo fence, pre-roll, display, search targeting. The only aspect I haven't directly sold and managed is audio.\n\nLooking to introduce a home service mom & pop to a Programmatic campaign as an alternative to outdoor, meta and Google search. Looking to reach homeowners (no additional &/or statements) with cross-device targeting within a <5 mile radius at an aggressively low CPM. Able to add a tracking pixel to their site. Don't want to be locked into something long term and min spend should be reasonable.",
