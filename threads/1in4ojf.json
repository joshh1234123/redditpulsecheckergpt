      "body": "You’ll find a lot of naysayers but mostly because the programmatic industry is going through a transformational shift. Certifications are good to start but they are also easy to complete. Promote yourself on LinkedIn, engage respectfully and ask questions rather than preach the word of RTB. Most importantly the best jobs are the jobs you get from a referral. \n\nYou can also do the courses which helps with foundational knowledge but it doesn’t compare to true experience in the space. \n\nI have some certifications for all things AdTech, video, native, etc on [AdTechGod](https://www.adtechgod.com). \n\nThey are all free. \n\nGood luck and don’t get discouraged.",

Hopefully you have personality. :)  Be willing to contract if you want it bad enough and if you get in, always overdeliver.  Look for AI companies in this space with stable funding.  Just realize this isn’t the sort of industry where you can stay at a single company for 20 years.  Have to keep moving to avoid the reaper.",

IMO, this role gets AI-fied or offshored first.. \n\nYou should find roles that are programmatic adjacent. Look into the vendor side that is part of the flywheel. \n\nIf you must, agency is your best bet to start out. The range in salary for the role has decreased or my company is cheap",
