So the goal is to get maximum value out of you. Which means pouring on the work until you are past max.  \n\nAnd then you deal with clients or in-house leaders that don't really understand marketing/advertising. So you are given goals that are impossible with low budgets and then they're mad when its not amazing.  \n\nBUT - I think programmatic is great to get into.

Programmatic is where a lot of the industry is moving, especially with the AI revolution.\n\nIn regards to programmatic, it’s important to choose a company that will train you properly within a DSP. Many DSPs are similar enough that once you have a base knowledge, you can grow from there. TTD, DV360, Viant, Yahoo, etc.\n\nWe need more critical thinkers in the digital space, so the best way to grow is to take any education courses both internally and externally to learn the lingo/how technology works together - DSP, DMP, SSP, Pubs, etc. \n\nYou made a good choice in joining programmatic! Don’t let the people who have been here too long discourage you, a good trader is always valuable!",

      "body": "Late to the party, but here’s my POV.\n\nProgrammatic is scary because it is so vast. We’re talking about the entire open internet, save the walled gardens of social platform and search engines. The internet is a massive space, with increasingly more bad content being monetized and, as noted by almost every comment on this thread, plagued by fraud. Navigating this can, and will be, hard and at times exhausting. You solve for one bad player, 5 more show up next week. The cycle doesn’t stop.\n\nThese problems become even more exasperated when you are not at a holding company sized agency with resources and teams dedicated to doing a lot of the inventory management and negotiation, allowing you to just focus on buying and optimizing.\n\nI started at a hold co and learned a TON. I am not at a smaller mid-market agency where we do not have a team dedicated to all the different facets of programmatic (data/targeting, identity resolution, analytics/tracking, inventory curation, etc.). When it is just you, or a small team, there are not enough hours in the day to do all of this in a meaningful way for a larger book of clients. Often times, it becomes a matter of getting things in market, optimizing to the best you can, and making sure you don’t set and forget and wind up with a display campaign that ran for 6 months and drove a 3.5% CTR. \n\nAll of that to say, I love programmatic. The technology is fascinating to me, I find it a lot more interesting than other paid channels that operate in a walled garden and there’s no “competitive edge” to any platform/vendor/tool.\n\nIf you go the holding company way, absorb as much as you can. Meet people who are not hands on keyboard and talk to them about what they do day to day (think roles that would typically fall in some iteration of a center of excellence).\n\nIf you go the small-mid agency route, be ready to get pulled in a lot of different directions. I am more involved than ever in the actual “business” side of the agency, more involved in creative conversation, more involved in analytics and tracking, etc. \n\nBoth are rewarding and both come with obvious pros and cons. At the end of the day we all put pictures on the internet. Do what you can, learn as much as possible, keep up (to the best of your ability) with the industry, and have some fun. When it stops being fun, identify what facet of programmatic you like the most and find somewhere that will let you do that for a living (often times this will be holdco or adtech) \n\nYou got this!",

      "body": "Let's just face it that there are some people managing programmatic for advertisers that don't put in the real effort needed to reduce bad quality traffic and inventory. Neither do some put in the effort needed to really work on the analytics and optimization side with the right tools to improve results. Poor quality / poor results of course leads to a reputation for programmatic with some advertisers as being a less attractive channel.\n\nUnfortunately, some people want the easy route so they just use maybe a single platform for all their buying, only use mostly the built in tools and use whatever optimization, brand safety and fraud prevention that is built in on auto-pilot. We all know this won't help in all scenarios.\n\nOn the other hand, thinking you can avoid any bot traffic or low quality traffic entirely is very naive. That won't be possible. You won't avoid bot traffic entirely if you go buy a large publisher directly either, it has nothing to do with programmatic. Which sites do you think AI bots for example prefer to scrape to get content into their machinery and do whatever they do with it (learn/train their AI, rewrite it for SEO spam farms and so forth)? Of course they love to visit high quality publishers and scrape their content. Do these bots load ads. Of course they do. It will happen even if you book a direct campaign with a top quality publisher. So don't be naive and think you can reduce low quality traffic to zero in your campaigns. The question is rather how can you with a lot of active work reduce it to a level you and the advertiser can accept, most likely because the positive results from the ad campaign will mitigate the waste from the bot/fraud/low quality traffic.\n\nDon't hesitate to get into programmatic but if you do, expect to do a lot of work if you want to be above the X% in performance who take the easy route and deliver medium/poor quality ad campaigns for their clients. Your campaigns will most likely not be great if you only rely on auto-pilot tools. So get your skills up in analytics, optimization and so forth. If you see a huge discrepancy between clicks and real site sessions then go in there and do something about it. But if you don't even know you have that problem, then you are probably part of the X%.",

I work for Polygraph. We detect and prevent click fraud (a type of ad fraud). Our core principle is *ethics before sales* and we try to do everything properly.

It's super depressing and has caused me to reevaluate my opinion of the world (there must be fraud and cheating everywhere).\n\nIn an opaque world like programmatic, fraud is pretty much built into the system, and almost everyone is looking the other way.
