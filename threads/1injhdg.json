      "body": "The ad-tech market has become more structured following a period of consolidation. Many mid-sized players went out of business, while others merged or were acquired. Today, the landscape consists of a few dominant giants, a handful of mid-sized players, and a broader base of smaller companies.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2022, the industry saw significant consolidation, with deals like the Rubicon-Telaria merger and IAS acquiring Publica. These moves were driven by the need for scale and strategic expansion, particularly for companies aiming to go public. Many acquisitions focused on integrating CTV capabilities to align with market trends.\n\nWhile the overall market remains stable, occasional rising stars emerge—recent examples include Vibe and StackAdapt. Smaller players may still get acquired early, but such deals are unlikely to reshape the broader ad-tech landscape. Any significant movement in the near future is more likely to come from the retail media sector.",

Seems like ad tech is mostly in a state of inertia: few small players are scaling fast enough to justify acquisition, larger long-term independents and their investors patiently waiting for IPO conditions to improve, and regulatory scrutiny effectively sidelines Big Tech from major M&A. AI just adds uncertainty - totally freezing strategic decision-making on all sides.  \n\nMedia consolidation: absolutely existential, yes. I think we'll see lots of urgent deals like Getty-Shutterstock. \n\n*Maybe* some interesting stuff from NFLX, AMZN/WMT--?",

It’ll be interesting to see how this impacts independent platforms and innovation overall. Tools like Attekmi’s AdEx Enterprise ad exchange solution https://attekmi.com/adex-enterprise might actually benefit from this trend, since more companies will be looking for flexible, customizable tech stacks instead of being tied to one of the big networks.",
