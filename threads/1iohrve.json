Do you have any post-bid reporting from IAS/DV or any post-bid analytics of your clicks actually leading to something? You mentioned you're bidding for maximum conversions, are you actually seeing conversions come through? If so, what's the conversion event associated with your line items? Do you have just 1 floodlight tracking page-views, or are you also tracking downstream activity on site to validate that there's actually something happening?",

      "body": "Despite having IAS & DV, you might still be exposed to bot traffic, this hypothesis shouldn't be excluded.\n\nAnother angle would be how the publisher has set-up its ad-placement, maybe in a way that creates an abnormal click incentive / some kind of MFA business.\n\nInstead of running reports as the exchange level, I'd rather go with a url report, just isolate a few that have abnormal CTR and take a look at the site to see how the ad placements are configured. Should be fairly easy & fast as a first check. \n\nDepending on what you find, we might explore other angles.",

Our Display camps are all RTG so the belief is that the AI Retargeted the invalid traffic and just crushed out ATC numbers.
