And what was the point of creating a feed / link with business merchant?\n\nTo be more specific, I'm not sure to understand whether your challenge is just about setting up the campaign & targeting the right format, or rather to create the ads format (that seem to be related to a product catalog somehow), or maybe upload all of those infeeds ads in an automated way? Or maybe something else?\n\nAny specific a practical detail would help so we can provide guidance.",

So, we started looking for alternative ways and came across the method of:\n\nCreating a feed (CSV/JSON) with ad variations, linking it to Business Merchant Center (BMC) to store the product/ad catalog, connecting BMC to DV360 to dynamically serve ads.\n\nHowever, since we don’t have much experience with this setup, we’re wondering:\n\nIs BMC + DV360 the best way to achieve in-feed ad automation?  \nIs there an alternative way to dynamically serve ads that blend within article text?  \nHow do we ensure the correct setup so that the feed-based ads are automatically generated and adequate product from the feed is previewed in the article based on contextual relevance or user behavior?\n\nTo sum it up, is there the best way of setting up in-feed automated ad campaigns in DV360?",

      "body": "\\##In-Feed Ads\n\nIf you want ads that blend naturally within article text, in-feed is definitely the right way to go.\n\n\\##BMC + DV360 Integration\n\nYou can connect BMC directly with DV360, but it’s not just about linking the feed. There are a few key steps to get it working properly:\n\n* First, make sure your DV360 account is set up at the advertiser level to support dynamic creatives. This means mapping the data creative profile to match your BMC feed.\n\n* In BMC, ensure that product details are always up to date before sending them to DV360. This includes product availability, price updates, and other key data. DV360 should automatically pull these updates to reflect changes in your ads.\n\n* Check that the feed is correctly captured in the Resource / Dynamic Creative section in DV360. This is where you’ll see the data being processed.\n\n* When adding creatives to your line items, select Dynamic Creative Ads. DV360 offers a few basic templates to format your product feed into ads, but you can also upload your own template using Google Web Designer or Studio.\n\n* You can set up feed rules to make the ads more dynamic. For example, if an item is on sale, you can highlight the promo, or you can show specific products to different audience segments based on predefined rules.\n\nThis setup can be a bit overwhelming at first, but once everything is in place, the real opportunity begins. Optimizing ad conditions and targeting to ensure your ads are shown in the most relevant way is where you’ll see a real uplift in performance. Advanced analyses and scripiting to implement such logic can be very helpful.\n\nOne more thing, bear in mind that feeds information in DV360 aren't necessarily real time, so if you want to check for every change you make, you might have to wait for a few hours.",
