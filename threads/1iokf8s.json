I did not see the potential the street is betting on. I understood why they acquired MoPub and I thought it was the necessary strategy back then not only to them but to any other company that's didn't have an SSP. Other companies followed the same strategy but haven't had their share price skyrocket.",

AdTech changes so fast and is dominated by monopolies and is heavily impacted by their decisions or laws. Every company is fragile no matter how it's well managed.\n\nAdTech is somehow similar to AI and Crypto: innovative, fast paced, and unpredictable. The focus on the CEO is secondary. Mediamath had a brilliant CEO, visionary, and had many things right, and add to that a great product, yet the company went bankrupt.\n\nAs for the internal structure, that wasn't why Netflix changed the deal with TTD. And here again you can see that external factors, i.e Netflix adding more partners, have more impact than internal ones.",
