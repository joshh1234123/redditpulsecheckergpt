      "body": "Because they aren’t getting 80% margins out of an overall cpm bid. From a media buying client perspective, they have 80% margins within their tech/fee features fees, which accounts for about 10-20% of the overall cpm depending. It’s why they push so hard to use their own features. They likely take off the top from data companies and media companies for providing the demand as well, but I’m not familiar with that side of their business.\n\nIf TTD had 80% margins on the overall cpm, every other dsp would be that much more competitive because TTD clients would have to bid so much higher in order to clear inventory.",

So yes, less dollars are going to “media”.\n\nThat said- why do you use a DSP in the first place? Why not just go direct? The fees are giving you features that help you optimize to your campaign KPIs plus the ability to decision/decide who you want to hit.\n\nAt the end of the day, an impression doesn’t mean much to a business. You can serve a billion impressions but if you’re selling tampons and all of your impressions go to 80 year old men, that’s not effective. So in this case the fees are going toward giving you in-market audiences + optimizing to an actual KPI, not just number of impressions served.",
