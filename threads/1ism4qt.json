You can filter publishers based on User geo = Canada and explore depending on formats you're looking for (CTV, OLV, Audio, Display).\n\nOtherwise, you have a few big ones like Bell Media, CBC, Rogers, Corus, The Globe and Mail, and many more on the english-speaking side. On the french-speaking side you also have Bell Media, Quebecor, Radio-Canada, La Presse etc.\n\nObviously the big players (incl. streaming) like YouTube, Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+ are huge in Canada (but not Canadian publishers).",
