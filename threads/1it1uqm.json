The second thing that’s gonna help you actually having a value and doing research on the client you’re trying to sell to- that sounds basic but doing some bare minimum basic research on the client the person you’re talking to is working on will go along way. Personally, I have my own partners and my own people I want to work with so for you to come in and make any headway whatsoever requires you to actually bring something new or valuable to the table.",

      "body": "Agencies are tough to crack. They're overstretched and have hundreds of people like you reaching out to them for similar reasons. They also have preferred partners with deals in place that allow them to skim a big chunk of cream off the top. Eg buy premium placements at a $10 cpm and sell them on to clients at two or three times that.\n\nYou need to be tenacious but not annoying which is a very fine line. Also recognise they're dealing with publishers that absolutely dominate your inventory numbers which just makes things harder.\n\nOverall my suggestion would be that you should be more strategic if you aren't already and target specific clients that suit your audience rather than the shotgun approach.\n\nBut also they do prefer open market because they love cheap impressions.",
