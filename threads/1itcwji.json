      "body": "In most scenarios I’m going TTD. Say what you will about the tech taxes that get added on along the way, but they’re “relatively” transparent. I lost a lot of respect for Google when they deprecated their service level almost entirely. Google is officially a pay to play space, where only the largest of advertisers get a direct line into Google. Resellers add additional fee on top and is an extra layer of people to go through just to get “let us talk to our team at Google” as an answer to most questions.\n\nTTD at least feels like they are designing a platform that serves the little guy as much as they do the big guys in the space. Features like the S&P500+ and some of the newer brand safety/verification tools available off the shelf, in my opinion, are helping smaller agency’s and buying teams take out the MASSIVE amount of work that inventory curation takes to execute properly. Are they perfect solutions? Absolutely not. Am I optimistic and hopeful about the direction they are moving the platform? absolutely.\n\nAll that to say, Googles data, as black box as it is, is still robust and rich. And as long as YouTube remains in the Google walls, it will always have a purpose.\n\nTo me it felt like TTD leaned into emerging formats over the past 5+ years in a way that DV just simply did not. In a programmatic world where just display and OLV no longer cut it, I want a platform that invests in developing good CTV, DOOH, and AUD capabilities.",

They’re not perfect, and you have to manage the fees they can tack on, but if you’re actually trying to market and not spit some KPI metric out it’s not even close.",

TTD lost it for us because of the new changes to the workflow with periodic table and some other stuff. Plus we did not want surprises at the end of the month with their high fess (27% in some cases). I think with the recent earnings report, it will make them more desperate and we don't like working with them because their pitch these days is - 'Google will exit the open web' and not 'We are better'.",

TTD is far more transparent, has much better support, not even close to the fees you suggest, and has far superior custom algos than DV360.   Also have not heard anyone talk about google exiting the open internet… but not sure that would be a reason to chose a partner?  Free audiences are good in DV, but I often question the value? I’d rather pay for purchase data from Walmart in TTD vs some of the google audiences based on actual performance we have seen.",
