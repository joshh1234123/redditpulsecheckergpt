Wouldn't that mean that what would happen regularily is that some people would only see the bumper while others would only see the nonskip ads? Is there a way to be sure that the targeted audience would at least see one nonskip ad? I hope my questions are not stupid, just trying to create an acceptable solution for my client.",
