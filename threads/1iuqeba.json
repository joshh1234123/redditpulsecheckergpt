      "body": "I have used both, and the main thing I would check is if you can place a pixel with a conversion event. Quantcasts strength is with its dynamic lookalike targeting based off pixel data. Combining that with their cookieless targeting, you can get super low CPM and drive actions just based off volume.\n\nIf you are looking for a more holistic dsp with different 3p audiences, contextual tools, and solid support staff, StackAdapt can do pretty much all the things pretty well. Yes, their fee isnt transparent, but their CPMs are generally comparable to TTD and you can get added value for your spend.",

      "body": "My 2 cents. What I've seen with both is overall better performance from quantcast, likelt due to their data and targeting. Where i have seen StackAdapt out perform has been on native ctr. \nStackadapt has more channels and features on offer though so really depends on what you need to achieve. Feel free to drop me a DM if you want to chat.",
