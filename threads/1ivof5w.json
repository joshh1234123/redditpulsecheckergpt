      "body": "I really love working on an in-house team - I get to do the aspects of what I liked abt programmatic planning from agency side, but have the benefits of a large non-ads corporation (better pay, better hours, company perks, etc.). My team is full programmatic planning and HOK - we only use our AOR for trafficking and billing. My teammates are extremely programmatic savvy since we all came from agencies, but our innovation is more in line with what was hot 5 years ago. I would say the major downside is the growth potential is just not there like it is at an agency or a sales org. I think it really depends on where you want to go in your career next - like are you ok with being at the same level/role for multiple years, or are you trying to grow and be higher up at an organization? I don’t personally see myself in a sales related role and agency life was harsh to me, so I’m comfortable on an in-house team at the moment.",

The skillset is mostly the same, but more consistent which I prefer to learning a bunch of platforms for one-off campaigns with crazy clients.\n\nI'd say it's a great balance if you mildly enjoyed trading at an agency as an associate/analyst. You get far more input for your book of business and work directly with an Account Executive on proposals and performance goals.\n\nCompensation and benefits are far better than what I would have earned at a top agency without jumping ship every year to get a promotion. That gets very tiring.",

So there's a pretty big education gap on ad fraud and its consequences.",
