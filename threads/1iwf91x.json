      "body": "Congrats on your upcoming graduation! Not sure what a programmatic executive is referring to, but a programmatic trader is the person who is hands on keyboard - they are setting up the campaigns in the DSP (i.e. DV360, TTD, etc.). The other role you’ll often see is a programmatic planner/strategist - they are responsible for coming up with the media plans and strategy that the trader will then implement. I would recommend also taking The Trade Desk Academy Edge Certification. I think it will thoroughly teach you a lot of principles of programmatic. I hope that helps!",

      "body": "In some cases this might be basically the same thing but different companies might use different names.\n\nI would expect a 'trader' would be hands on keyboard, logging into a DSP and managing campaigns.\n\nA 'executive' might be something different depending on the company, it could be basically the same as a trader but a different title. But it could be more of an account manager if a company doesn't manage campaigns themselves.\n\nJust read the job descriptions and if it sounds like what you want to do then apply. If you get an interview do your research on the company and come prepared with questions about the job. Job listings can sometimes be vague or not give a sense of how much time is spent on what tasks. Good interviews will give you a chance to understand its the right role for you as much as them assessing you.",

I tend to look at the job description, especially if it gives me a sense of industry experience years to try and figure out how senior a role is.\n\nAs someone who does hiring, I'd say no harm in applying for something which looks like a good fit for your skills and interests. In some cases I might prefer a more junior but enthusiastic candidate or might have other suitable roles open or coming up to refer a good candidate towards.",
