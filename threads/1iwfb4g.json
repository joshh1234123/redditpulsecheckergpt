Unless it's something that management asks for that can lead to promotion/additional role advancement.\n\nAt the very least, take additional certification and platform trainings to bolster your education in programmatic. It's always evolving and never ending.\n\nI think your team will start piling on tasks soon enough. 3-4 weeks is nothing but learning the internal structure and programs from my experience.",

They’ll ease you into the role. \n\nWhat I would do is use the free time to network internally, schedule calls with people, gain insights on the internal processes, introduce yourself to the leadership, get all the HR crap buttoned up… position yourself now and not later. \n\n3 weeks is early to ask for more. If you are still light in work in 3-4 months then def talk to your manager and let them know you have some bandwidth.",
