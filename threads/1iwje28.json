The entire CTV environment is predicated on the “lean back” or “relax effect”.\n\nFor a user to engage with a QR code they have to mentally register the brand, decide to engage, grab their phone, and scan the code all within the allotted time slot. In my experience, the only way that comes close to working is with a ~5x-7x frequency + strict dayparting of 8pm-10pm. TV watching during that time is more active than passive.\n\nFor performance marketing on CTV, you’re better off working with a DSP that has a cross device graph and can attribute CTV exposure to on-site activity / conversions / purchases.\n\nYou’re welcome to keep the QR code on the unit, but make the scans a tertiary metric after View-Thru conversions and VTR.",

QR can help but isn’t an ultimate solution as not everyone will scan your ad, a lot of people will either go direct or through search.\n\nI’d advise against going direct unless you have specific shows/contents you want to target and very sizeable budget. Pick a platform that has access to as many channels as possible.\n\nI’d recommend starting with retargeting. CTV isn’t search where you can just target a high intent keyword and then expand from there. Retargeting allows you to get early insights and understand where performance is coming from at a low cost to then expand from it.\n\n45s creative won’t be approved on most inventories, you should try to cut it down to 30s.\n\nThere are a couple platforms that can provide that with the leading ones being Vibe, Mountain and TVScientific.\n\nHappy to answer any questions you might have.",
