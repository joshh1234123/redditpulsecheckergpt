      "body": "Are you wanting managed service or self serve? \nWhat channels are you using currently with your existing DSP?\n\nTaboola wouldn’t be one on my radar tbh given their past but I’ll admit Realize looks pretty cool for a small brand. However, inventory wise most DSPs access whatever inventory you’ll want these days. All DSPs now are preaching “transparency” so I’d really prioritize:\n\n1) ease of use (do you have ads or need them made? A creative studio would be nice to have on a DSP then)\n2) do you have an ad server you’ll use as a source of truth or DSP numbers will be used?\n3) you’re a brand, can you easily onboard 1P data without support from the DSP \n4) do you have access to a dedicated support rep and are there SLAs in place for them to respond to you\n5) contextual capabilities \n6) reporting - if you’re doing things outside of programmatic for your brand, can you use the DSP’s API to pull all of your data across channels into a report\n7) inventory quality/brand safety - IMO both of these DSPs are meh in this area. Taboola specifically has been bottom feeder trash inventory for a long time. \n\nThere’s more to consider but you get the gist.",

      "body": "I've worked with small brands and my first question to them (if they are not digital native) is always: what are you hoping to get from programmatic that you can't get from search/social?\n\n\nProgrammatic is either for high budgets or small budgets+high skills. High budgets still require skills, but they allow you to fail and test&learn, which you can't do with small budgets.\n\n\nIf your goal is to try programmatic because you want to learn along the way without having specific targets to hits, then that's a fair objective (i.e. gaining in knowledge and up skilling).\n\n\nMy humble advice if you're too small and with limited or no programmatic knowledge: 1/get an ad server 2/directly deal with the publishers that reach your audiences. Yes, it might be a bit more expensive (in money and time), but you diminish the risk of fraud and buying crappy traffic (which end up more expensive).\n\n\nI'm sharing this knowing that I'm pro programmatic, pro in-house, pro dsp. I certainly don't recommend working with small DSPs. They've got to pay the bills and the investors (or the other way around if unlucky), and they don't care about the traffic they buy, which can permanently damage your brand.",

Taboola really excels at building brand awareness and driving website traffic through promoting organic content, financing, and special offers \n\nSimplifi is better to advertise specifically to car buyers through using dynamic inventory ads to advertise specific vehicles. Simplifi can also implement geo conversion zones to track foot traffic to the dealership with many of our tactics which I do not think taboola can do.\n\nHappy to talk further. Best recommendation I can make overall is to meet with both companies and get a proposal.",
