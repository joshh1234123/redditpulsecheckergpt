Follow the STAR approach\n3. Have the confidence, fake it till you make it\n4. Be as exhaustive as possible\n5. Examples need to be mapped to each of their leadership principles, try identifying which LP they are looking at with the question present\n6.Do have questions for the panel to understand the team dynamics,eg. Fav part of working with this team, how are people given growth opportunities given how toxic amazon is sound to be\n7. Bar raisers are usually out of the team, you can identify them easily by looking at them on linkedin. Keep your answers simple w them as they would not understand your jargons.\n\n\nAll the best!
