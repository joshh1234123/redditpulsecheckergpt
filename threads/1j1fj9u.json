If it pulls in info from outside your provided sources, it actually tells you—so you know right away and can decide how much to trust it.  \nWith NotebookLM, the answers come straight from what you’ve given it. ChatGPT, on the other hand, usually needs you to specifically ask for that, and even then, it might still mix in outside info without saying so, which can get a bit annoying.",
