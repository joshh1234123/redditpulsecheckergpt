But if you offer something the existing players don’t then you could have an opportunity even if your platform lacks some of their features and scale.",

      "body": "Yeah sorry about the confusion. It's a player with anayltics tracking all kinds of different metrics related to how many plays, view through rates, domains where it was served, how long the ads are viewed and more granular stats as well. There's a CDN but if an agency has a preferred CDN (I'm sure many don't but just in case) we can plug that in as well. Basically a way to serve your video ads on any device. Some agencies might use AI tools as well for video ad creation. If incorporating some of that is helpful that's also an option. Finally, ad fraud filtering tools...we've got that too. Hopefully this adds some clarity.",
