      "body": "Most of non-tech people find everything confusing in adtech. And I hate to say it, most are not curious enough and don't want to learn.\nYes, AdTech is a fast paced changing industry and it's hard to keep up, especially when you get flooded by sales BS. Yet, there are a lot of resources that one can have a hand on and and become an expert.\n\nThe most confusing topic is still, unfortunately, privacy sandbox. I reckon it's not an easy one.\n\nThen, then there are topics which concepts are somewhat easy to understand but require expertise level to address them operationally and strategically.\n\nI'd say that it'll depend on what audience you want to target. Measurement is complex if you see it from a data scientist perspective. Identity is complex from a legal perspective. Attribution is complex from fraud perspective. Clean Rooms is complex from integration perspective.",

      "body": "Adtech can be a bit like the Mos Eisley Cantina in Star Wars, not very easy to get a grip on. In my experience you learn a lot from talking with other people from the industry, watching demos, asking questions. Each one works on their own piece of the industry and if they build their own adtech products they usually know that part very well. Participating in industry associations can also give a really accelerated learning curve.",

      "body": "Measurement is easily the most important but also most confusing topic imo, too much snake oil as I like to call it saying things which are either completely false or only work for a subset of channels / markets.\n\nThe inner workings of Programmatic from an OpenRTB / Bid Request perspective seems to be lost on the large amount of advertisers / agencies. Understandably it doesn't seem to be as critical in this day & age, but I can somewhat guarantee if there was better knowledge on this, certain issues that plague the industry would not be as problematic. The way programmatic is taught nowadays is either 1) click a button and let the algo do it, 2) do something smart / custom but don't ask too many questions or very shortly 3) let AI take the burden.\n\nEducation is something very important to me personally, almost to a hobby level. Best way I learn is by following the right people or practically doing something.",

Although those presentations were recorded, I insisted AM/Sales attend them for a live interaction.\n\nMost of the time, unfortunately though, I found myself having to explain the basics again so that the knowledge from vendors is put in context.\n\nI've also noticed that certain companies are simply not organised in the best way to allow knowledge transfer. Gotta say it's typical to AdTech for reasons I'm yet to clarify.",
