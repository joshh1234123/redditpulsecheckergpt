Maybe it’s more impactful for CPG and retail but never saw any Epsilon products that I felt moved the needle or that our clients were beholden to. Was shocked they were doubling down on 1PD but I’m sure they know more than me. Epsilon as a whole though feels like a pretty useless organization that is stuck in the Stone Age. Many of our clients that have been sold on Epsilon have quickly come back when they realize how unhelpful that team is",
