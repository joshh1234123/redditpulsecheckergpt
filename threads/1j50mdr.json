      "body": "I got downvoted when I commented, on my own post about TTD's share drop to 80 usd (and applovin's increase to 520), that the share price won't jump back anytime soon and that, in fact, it'll keep decreasing because TTD's resilience is yet to be proven.\n\nI know many who jumped on the bandwagon and bought the 80 usd shares. It's now at 65 usd.\n\nTTD's communication has been misleading a few times (remember the rumours about Netflix when they were looking for an adtech partner), and it was about time they got in trouble because they're a listed company. I'm not surprised by this lawsuit at all. It's a warning to every company out there trying to charm investors. US laws protect against that. But again I do hope TTD won't get into much trouble and get their shit together because adtech needs companies like TTD to challenge the status quo, i.e. the Walled Cesspits.",

      "body": "Not sure how far these cases will go, but if they get into discovery and that discovery comes out in court it will absolutely fascinating. Hard to see it getting that far though. I imagine TTD would rather settle. \n\nThat said, I think the issue of the lawsuit is boiled down to the disconnect between TTD management and actual customers. If you look at what Jeff says on earnings calls and in the Kokai Edge Academy videos, he believes he can do your job better than you can with this new UI. Technically that was also true of Solimar at first when they had you go through the new campaign set up wizard. In both cases, it is an excessive amount of Hubris to tell a client you know their job better than they do. He implies that the software will find new buying opportunities for traders that will meet goals and increase spend. Yes he doesn’t seem to bother to recognize that the vast vast majority of people logging into and using his software are low level data entry ICs who have no input and no budget authority whatsoever. \n\nMaybe that’s why they’re so gung ho on going client direct, but what does he think is going to happen when he has a client with no programmatic experience login to this convoluted UI that tells them very little and requires 5+ clicks to see anything meaningful? \n\nSo in that, maybe these cases will have merit if they show that TTD leadership is flying by the seat of their pants (that 15 point plan sure sounded like it on the earnings call), and that they were taking out of their ass about Kokai when really all the internal data showed a totally different picture. It would be ironic as can be if the man who trumpets data in philanthropy ignored data in his multibillion dollar enterprise but I wouldn’t be shocked",

      "body": "Ok maybe I’m just a simpleton, but how does this suit even have merit? \n\nFrom what I read the allegations seem to boil down to “TTD experienced technical difficulties while updating its platform to kokai.” \n\nNot only are there issues every time TTD does a platform update, but they seem to always get fixed eventually, even now. Surely this isn’t the first time shareholders notice this hiccup. Are shareholders in this case alleging that TTD *purposefully* caused their platform to run suboptimal? \n\nIf impaired forecasting and campaign performance as a result of product updates warrants a lawsuit, then I would think that would put the other tech megaliths in danger.",
