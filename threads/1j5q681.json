      "body": "Clean rooms are just privacy-regulated boxes to do a vlookup in. \n\nI'm grossly oversimplifying but, as with all data platforms, a clean room only makes sense if it adds new data to your measurement ecosystem or pipes it somewhere really neatly. ie. If there are exposure logs, third party data, etc that will only play nicely in Habu, then using the platform as a way to access stuff is helpful. \n\nHowever, the more common use of clean rooms is: match your X data with your Y data! \n\nYou can do all that in snowflake, aws, gcp. Liveramp and others also have RUM-based integrations with all those platforms, so identifiers via clean rooms aren't really unique.",

Do you have an understanding of what your overlap is between those 3 different options of data or even media?\n\nWhat if you've got 30% overlap between your different audience segments? Could that mean that you're overspending to the same people, resulting in an over abundance of frequency (major issue in CTV).\n\nIf you're working with multiple sources of data (all different types of ID's and methodologies) and you're leveraging several measurement platforms with different methodologies for measurement, are you overcounting \"conversions\" or \"results\"? Having some insight into these types of things (among others) could help your ad dollars be more efficient.\n\nLiveRamp is one option, but they're often very expensive, hard to work with, slow and their coverage isn't as great as they'd make you believe.",

      "body": "Let me give you some use cases of why clean rooms are required and why everyone will be using it anyway.\n\nScenario: Measuring Cross-Platform Ad Performance Without Cookies\n\nA leading e-commerce brand runs a multi-channel ad campaign across Google Ads and programmatic platforms. They want to measure which ads drive the most conversions but third-party cookies are no longer reliable due to browser restrictions and privacy regulations.\n\nSolution: LiveRamp RampID Matching via a Data Clean Room (DCR)\n\nA user clicks a Google Ad and visits the e-commerce website. They log in or make a purchase, linking their activity to the brand’s first-party CRM data. Data Matching via RampID ,Google assigns an anonymous Google ID to the user. LiveRamp assigns a RampID to the same user based on the brand’s first-party data the two IDs are matched in a privacy-safe way via a clean room. The advertiser queries matched impression & conversion data to see which ads performed best.\n\nSQL Query to Measure Matched Ad Conversions\n\nThis query counts the number of matched conversions by ad campaign.\n\n    WITH Matched_Users AS (\n      SELECT \n        adh.google_ads_campaign_id AS campaign_id, \n        COUNT(DISTINCT adh.external_cookie) AS matched_conversions\n      FROM `adh.google_ads_impressions_match` AS adh\n      INNER JOIN `project_name.dataset_name.customer_data` AS cust\n      ON LOWER(TO_HEX(adh.external_cookie)) = cust.rampid\n      GROUP BY campaign_id\n    )\n    \n    SELECT \n      campaign_id,\n      matched_conversions\n    FROM Matched_Users\n    ORDER BY matched_conversions DESC;\n\nSimilarly you can do much more things in privacy safe way  like building audiences, custom attribution model,  report on viewability metrics.\n\nAmazon DSP also has its onw DCR named as Amazon Marketing Cloud which also uses SQL.\n\nIn short you absolutely need it, hate it or love it, you cannot ignore it for sure and you will miss alot of data as cookies will become useless anyway 40-50% data will be lost, tanginle use cases  can be many depends on your ability to write SQL -you can do regression based modelling, markov chain analysis for conversion modelling, custom audience building.\n\nEvery marketer by now  must accept that cookies are going away, client side tracking is ineffective , 3rd party data is dying - so server side tracking, first party data, customer match, clean rooms, conversion api, conversion modelling are the future... marketers will have to learn new tech skills  python sql cloud computing, ML etc\n\nThere is Red pill and Blue pill - choose your pill wisely\n\nThere are many clean room service provider Ads data Hub is offered by Google , AMC by amazon DSP, Data bricks also offers one, SnowFlake DCR - but I prefer Ads data hub as it is integrated with BigQuery and Google DSP...If you explore it more you will be able to find many use cases that will set you apart from traditional marketers to modern tech savvy marketers..\n\nRefer the Product Docs of Ads data hub and for AMC >  [https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/overview](https://advertising.amazon.com/API/docs/en-us/guides/amazon-marketing-cloud/overview)",

You also may need multiple data clean rooms to support different partners, which is a pain and could cause some spend consolation to the walled gardens.",
