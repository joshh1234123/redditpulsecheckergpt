      "body": "You need someone to run a build vs buy analysis. There are integration partner as a service (IPaaS) companies. But your use case seems quite niche in terms of who you want to integrate with. Some names that come to mind workato, prismatic and fivetran but there are many many more. \n\nThere are also open source companies that offer something like this. Can’t remember any of the names right now. We did a similar analysis at my last company and chose the open source company (as it was free and we could\nHost it in our env plus it passed privacy and security reviews etc…). Even if they don’t have pre-built connectors they have a standardised model you can use for new but you obviously have to invest dev time in implementing such a solution so this needs to be weighed up against just building everything yourself as part of the analysis",

      "body": "This is a common challenge across Ad-tech especially as channels like pDOOH mature and more players enter the space. Part of what you are describing can solved by something called a header-bidder. 1 api that manages all your other integrations and API’s. My personal favourite was AdStash’s, but Hivestack and Broadsign now offer header bidders as well. However, I can’t imagine companies who own their own DSPs will be a true unified auction compared to other header-bidders owned by independent companies. Hope this helps and good luck.",
