We've done some tests of running pre-recorded (non-host read) spots across many podcasts, and the results were nowhere close to our host-read ads.  There's some magic to having the hosts read the ads, people are less likely to skip them, and are more likely to be influenced by the ad to take action as it sounds like a personal endorsement.\n\nYour mileage may vary, but we'll be sticking with direct buys for mid-roll creative with host-read creative.  Also making sure the hosts aren't sticking 6+ ads in the middle (some publishers like iHeart may do this with their podcasts), 3-4 seems fine though.",

I do think we benefit from the open market deals but know there is more potential that may be hampered by our podcasts not being able to accommodate MAID targeting. We can only target down to IP address in podcasts. Do you think programmatic buyers will come around to doing podcast specific deals without MAID targeting so they can access scale in podcasts specifically? ",

      "body": "Spotify getting into podcasts has muddied the water for sure. Advertisers think they are reaching podcast listeners when they buy spotify, but spotify users are primarily using the app for streaming, so when they listen to a podcast, they are doing so in a more casual manner. The traditional podcast listener is SUPER engaged, seeking out a specific episode, downloading it, and listening to the entire thing, often only exposed to a few ads within an hour. Many of the publishers out there are cramming in 20+ ads an hour which is not appropriate for podcast content as it isn't like radio which is formatted for a lot of little chunks of content interrupted by ad breaks. I think this is also where PMPs set up directly with a podcast publisher that offers low ad load is of value. Because then you are actually testing high quality podcasts and can develop learning around podcast performance vs audio everywhere or streaming campaigns.",

I think a lot of the poor performance comes from poor inventory with shows that cram a ton of ads in, so listeners end up skipping over them or they are stacked in postroll pods with 6 ads back to back. Having that direct relationship with the seller is important even in a programmatic scenario so you have confidence in the inventory.",

The only issue you face with Spotify is the autoplay which is annoying - and the algorithm seems to prioritize Spotify hosted (Megaphone) and those that participate in their ad network OVER what you actually listen to. \n\nThat said, I don't think programmatic buying is right for this market. I know that isn't the question but working in podcasts - I can tell you firsthand, you want a direct relationship with the host.

Transparency is also important - with a PMP, we can curate a show list so you know exactly what you are running in whereas with open market always on deals, podcasts can get lumped into audio everywhere which can be low quality made-for-advertising websites, in app audio placements, all kinds of things that are not the high quality podcast environment you actually want. \n\nAnd yes most listen on mobile, but the only PII we get back from the user when they download via RSS feed is their IP address, so we are limited in what we can target against at the user level. As a result, we can only really do household level targeting. But with contextual targeting we can get more specific. ComScore has cool predictive contextual segments we use based on their panel that volunteers demo, purchase behavior, interest, in-market, etc against granular contextual environments they consume (all podcasts are transcribed now so we can dynamically insert into contextual environments that over index for B2B Decision makers in market for SaaS software for instance).",
