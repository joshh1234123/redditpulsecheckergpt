      "body": "I don’t quite follow the “lacking of ad units” for behavioral. Isn’t the format quality based on the inventory source, not the audience?\n\nIn terms of contextual vs behavioral, in my 10 years of programmatic, contextual has always been the worst performing targeting tactic because you are targeting a place and not a person. One hopes the person you want is on that contextual placement because it aligns with what your target audience is interested in. Targeting people over places has always provided better ROAS.",

At that low a price point you have to bank on converting a customer and having them repeat several times to be profitable.\n\nCheap CPMs mean cheap inventory.

You can create audience segments from shoppers of certain brands or products (lapsed of current within various timeframes). You can also measure the effectiveness of each creative, segment, tactic etc based on incremental purchases (in-store and online) and store visitation.",

Plenty of quality partners out there that can help drive cost-efficient highly relevant contextual buys without paying these crazy premiums. Feel free to shoot me a DM for any further questions",
