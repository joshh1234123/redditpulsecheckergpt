Although I've only had that issue with Internal systems not with external reports)",

      "body": "Thanks for the response! I don’t have that level of access to check, but I’m thinking I wouldn’t get any results pulling placement level without domain if something was wrong with tags. When I compare DSP impression numbers to IAS numbers, the discrepancy is small. It’s only when I add ‘domain’ in the mix where stuff goes downhill. Especially for TTD.",

I’ve been using IAS for years so far, and this hasn’t happened to me yet, but I can try and see if- thanks!\nI don’t think it’s long tail, the report isn’t that big and for my specific campaign I only see like 20 tracked ads in total, with most of them being tag testing.\nAdding domain doesn’t trigger anything else, like a shorter look-back, and usually when that is the case, you get a warning about it, you can either not pull the report or it comes out blank.\nThank you for the detailed input, though, I’ll give it another shot with filtering out some data to see if that will work.",
