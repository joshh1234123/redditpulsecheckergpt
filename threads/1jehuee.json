Although I haven't worked across MMM since very early days and when I was in house so I'm not sure where that lies but from personal experience I am skeptical of the value mix to how many currently invest.\n\nAlso further to moving away from post click is the value of Programmatic moving away from 'RTB' and being a pure acquisition channel. The movement to Curation and tight site lists I'd expect a shift of Branding activity to move away from direct IOs and move into Programmatic pipes.\n\nThere is a lot of potential in the future of programmatic but it's not going to be going 'backwards' to vanity metrics.",

But there are steps / processes that can be taken to prove the value of any media.",
