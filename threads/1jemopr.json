      "body": "This is a great discussion and one that's being had even at the IAB level for reclassification of some media to CTV-DOOH or something similar.\n\n I think coming from the DOOH side there needs to be some open and honest discussion so buyers know exactly what they are buying for sure. In my opinion we have outlived the DOOH label and not everything can be lumped into DOOH as they are drastically different. Example we operate a DooH network with full site sound and motion that could in theory be used by CTV and OLV buyers if they are looking for extra supply to extended and reuse the creative they already have on another screen yet we are compared to a digital billboard, transit or taxi-topper screen that are static.\n\nThis is a critical issue that the industry is grappling with—how to properly classify and position digital OOH inventory in a way that aligns with evolving buyer expectations and media planning strategies. The current DOOH label is too broad, encompassing everything from digital billboards to fully immersive screen networks with sound and motion, yet buyers often view all DOOH inventory as the same.\n\nOur network’s ability to support full-site sound and motion makes it far more aligned with CTV and OLV campaigns than with silent transit screens or roadside billboards. This is where reclassification, such as CTV-DOOH or an equivalent term, could help bridge the gap between traditional DOOH and video-first advertising channels. It would allow buyers to better understand what they’re getting and potentially open new budgets from digital video and programmatic buyers who wouldn’t normally consider DOOH.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, one challenge is that many buyers still think of DOOH primarily in terms of impressions rather than audience engagement, whereas CTV and OLV buyers are accustomed to metrics like completion rates, viewability, and interactivity. \n\nUltimately standardizing measurement around video-based engagement metrics (e.g., dwell time, audio-on impressions, etc.) could help differentiate high-value DOOH networks from the more static formats but 100% the buyer should know what they are buying.",

Are the ads meant for CTV (private space) okay to be displayed DOOH (public space)?\n\nI've heard that in certain countries that when an ad is approved for CTV it is by default approved for DOOH.\n\nThen, advertising/marketing wise: an Ad on CTV has...sound! The sound is part of the ad experience. While a soundless ad can have an impact (pushing one to hit volume up), its design has still to be adapted for DOOH.",

For Loop TV and Video Elephant, would they be providing content to play as well as filling requests?\n\nI have experienced DOOH networks struggle with the different magnitude of number of unique creatives from CTV demand, compared to DOOH demand. Essentially <100 new creatives per day from DOOH demand that buy for longer periods, and >1,000 new creatives a day from CTV that only buy a few times.\n\nThis also becomes an issue if creative review and brand safety are crucial. Brand safety being focused on the screen network's brand and the environment the screen is located in.",
