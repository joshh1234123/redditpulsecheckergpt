      "body": "Better targeting & retargeting , GA4 lets you build smarter audiences ( like... high-value visitors, cart abandoners) and send them to DV360 for precise ad targeting.  \nSmarter bidding  ,GA4 can pass conversion data back to DV360, so the bidding algorithm gets smarter and reduces wasted ad spend. You get a big-picture view of DV360 + Google Ads + organic traffic in one place, making cross-channel analysis easier.  GA4 data can be exported to BigQuery for deep dives, and you can create custom dashboards in Looker Studio.\n\ndownside-\n\nDV360 doesn’t support Google Ads-style auto-tagging, so you might miss tracking data. Use manual UTM parameters to fix this. GA4 isn’t real-time, so there’s a lag before DV360 data shows up. If you need instant insights, this could be a problem. If you rely on Floodlight for conversion tracking, GA4 won’t fully replace it, so keep that in mind.  \n\n\n# \n\n#",

      "body": "Linking DV360 and GA4 as an agency is a bit of a pain if your client is on a non-transparent agreement as DV360 cost data might flow into GA4 and expose your margins. Although, there is an option in DV360 to make sure your cost data does not go over to GA4. \nIf you are an agency if the above situation. Make sure you disable the cost data transfer option while linking.\n\nThe advantage if linking it is GA4 is able to show a better impact of your programmtic ads taking into consideration the view through conversions as well. Helps in creating an overall picture of the programmatic performance.",
