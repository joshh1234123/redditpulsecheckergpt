      "body": "You can optimize at the Deal level for various use cases—placement, site, viewability, and audience targeting. In some ways, this is more efficient than separating each deal into its own line item and optimizing individually. That said, I still prefer aggregating multiple deals within a single line item rather than assigning each its own. However, this approach makes it harder to optimize at the deal level, which is where having access to the curation platform becomes valuable, allowing for more precise deal-level optimizations.\n\n  \nAlso, the forecasting tools in some curation platforms are great to play with. They provide traders with additional insights and enhance their optimization toolkit.",

Inventory examples (viewability, attention, placement) Audience examples (intent, identity, commerce, etc). Ask your SSP partners for the full list of deal IDs that are running against your inventory and work to optimize the amount of inventory opted into those deals.",
