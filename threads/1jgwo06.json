For instance, serve a CTV ad @ $15, then retargeted the same user/household using display at $1. Double the frequency at a fraction of the cost.\n\nBetter optimizations for performance-based campaigns. Is video performing better than display? Move budgets. Is Audio sucking ass? Kill it.",

Let’s say It’s the best coke you’ve had and you only get your coke from there now, but now you’re craving something else, do you want to walk even farther to find another factory? Probably not.\n\nWell, Programmatic is like going to the nearby grocery store where there’s a variety of drinks with multiple flavors. Some being bad and some being good. You might want something other than coke so you try Pepsi or maybe a strawberry vanilla poppi that says it’s can help with gut health. You have a lot more variety but also a higher chance of finding something that doesn’t suit your tastes. \n\nSomeone check if this makes sense I just woke up lol.",

In some cases, just the added value is enough to convince a client, but that'll depend on the publisher and what they offer. If you put enough money on some of their darling formats/placements, they might even throw a couple M impressions on top in Display.  \n  \nAs for consolidation, you can always use CM to have everthing tagged and reported, even some DOOH inventory.",
