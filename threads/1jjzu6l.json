      "body": "As someone who's been in the industry a long time, I get that this is hugely frustrating to high-performing folks starting out. There are some things that you really only learn through experience- I often feel like at this point I've encountered almost every weird thing or bizarre client question (though as soon as I think that, someone surprises me), but when more junior people come to me with a 'how do I possibly answer this??' and I say oh, it's probably this thing or tell them this, and they want to know how to learn that... I don't have an answer. I don't know how to download 10+ years of in-the-trenches experience into some kind of training- anyone who figures that out is a genius.   \nSo it may not be what you want to hear, but be patient with yourself. Take EVERY opportunity to learn- attend vendor meetings and ask questions, find mentors in your company (or outside), read industry news, and learn from every campaign you work on or client you speak to-- there is always something you can improve or do better next time.   \nIf you stay hungry for knowledge, before you know it you will be the veteran who new folks look at wondering how on earth you learned it all.",

Programmatic is all that plus clicking into and out of A LOT of menus & sub menus in platforms + slack pings + annoying billing reconciliation emails + meetings that could've been emails + mandatory boring trainings + webinars + 10 other distractions... \n\nSo not really a huge learning curve given your analytics experience",

      "body": "I wouldn't worry. Programmatic is funny in that there is a BIG initial learning curve... and then you have a lot of little details that add up. \n\nIt is a great mix of creative, data, and then random experience. Pull x lever and get y result. Try it again? Hey- same result. So now you know how to get y result.  \n\nFast forward 3 months and that lever stops working.  \n\nWhat seems like institutional learning over time is just experience. And once you get to a more intermediate to expert level- then you really only can learn through experience and evaluation.  \n\nPlus, there are a lot of data points. From supply sources, to data segments, conversion metrics, viewability, blah blah etc. So you can fundamentally understand it all but have to get to a point where you can make assumptions about what the data is saying.   \n\nOne data segments may work really well on one group of websites or supply source and then perform badly on another. Why? Who TF knows.   \n\nSo just get in there and keep learning. Oh- and a lot of people believe they are programmatic geniuses, when really they just confident. A confident assumption always sounds better",

However, if you feel like you're still not learning the fundamentals and the intricacies of adserving, tagging, creatives, formats etc. then that's a poor reflection on the other team members and their willingness to help train up others. Although some of this could be learned through platform courses/trainings, this should really be hands on experience for a specific client or team so you understand the nuances of various ways of working",

      "body": "First, to answer your question, yes the learning curve in programmatic is massive. Things are changing rapidly with new acronyms everywhere. You are definitely not alone. I've been in the space for 10+ years and face new questions every day. As others have suggested, industry conferences may help fill in some gaps. I'd also recommend subscribing to some very good resources like Ad Tech Explained or Ari Paparo's Marketecture newsletter for more big picture industry news. In addition, the IAB has some decent courses as does U of Digital that may help if your company is willing to sponsor your education. Lastly, I'll add to remember this feeling and take the time to invest in those who come after you. If you can find a good mentor, they can really change the course of your career and paying that forward is not only rewarding but ensures the next high performer who comes along doesn't quit the industry because no one gave them the time and attention they needed. Good luck!",

Know that there are many out there that feel this way and try and remember that most people in this industry are continuously learning and growing! \n\nI would recommend finding a few resources out there that focus on walking through the Programmatic Ecosystem at a high-level (i.e. what is a DSP, SSP, Ad Server etc. and how they function together). There are some good YouTube videos out there on this, or Udemy courses. \n\nSometimes when you're in the weeds of the day-to-day, you're picking up enough to grasp what you're directly overseeing but it may feel like it's not fully \"clicking\" into place until you zoom out a bit and actually understand how the ecosystem functions as a whole. Understanding the big picture while also honing tactical skills should help with the learning curve. You've got this!",

      "body": "Have you completed any online certifications? What level of depth are you trying to understand the programmatic landscape? I would recommend looking into online certifications from the trade desk/stack adapt. I believe stack adapt has a bit more in depth course work than the trade desk but both are good. I would also say you just have to talk to people and ask questions. I feel like 2.5 years should be a decent amount of time to have built up a decent amount of programmatic knowledge. I personally am only 7.5 months in and made senior associate in 6 months. I believe this is because I just ask questions like there is no tomorrow. I will reiterate just ask questions. Ask your account manager questions, your dsp reps questions, your analytics/data science team questions. I mean really drill down and just keep asking questions, you will be surprised what you can learn.",

      "body": "It is complex and things are always changing. \nHowever, it does seem it can be lost on people they have their experience and can almost be gatekeepy as you mentioned for whatever reason. They can also state things that are incorrect and leave no room for questioning then that confusion/incorrectness gets passed down. I have had to come across things I thought was true in my early days that I am just not sure in general anymore even for basic things. Some people have been able to acquire their good experience while just being at 1-2 companies for many years and that is rare. Usually you get it by trying a few types of roles at different companies. Sometimes it is a bit of a waiting game, but other times you have to take control of your own career. I was blessed with certain experiences earlier in my career, but other experiences I was not able to fully get either not the opportunity available or the gatekeeping.\nKeep looking to get certifications in things you are able to. It might not be \"experience\", but it can help.\nListen to podcasts and read articles. Reach out to people to have convos. All of this can help, but again still not experience. \nHopefully you have a manager/leadership that wants to provide value to your career and willing to help in different ways, since that will be a key factor.\nThis all might not be helpful, but I have been around for a bit in this space and I too have some similar struggles. \nBest of luck to your endeavors and keep aiming to get that experience however you can.",

Which is great and I want to help them but I can't download 10+ years of experience.\n\nI also find roles have matured, some things are more siloed.\nI know a lot about tagging because I did years of adops before it was as automated as now.\nI came up in a small market and I did everything as digital marketing was a niche let alone programmatic, I was there for the start of programmatic in our agency.\n\nAnother thing is so much has changed over time, sometimes my experience doesn't feel relevant until a specific question pops up. And sometimes the things are actually outside my teams remit, while I can answer it I'd prefer they focus on their role, for example with tagging, we have specialised team who deal with that, I'd like them to lean on that team instead of trying to take on everything. (that said, you can learn if you pass an issue over to another team make sure to follow along what's happening, don't pass it off and forget it if you want to learn more)\n\nIf you find out any tips for downloading all that experience, let me know.\n\nMy advice to OP is just to stay curious, ask questions and keep figuring out how and why things work in certain ways and in time you'll get experience. Find the mentors who are responsive and helpful to your questions and keep building those relationships. All the knowledge comes with time of your there being involved.",
