      "body": "What is going to happen:\nGoogle will automatically add ALL conversion-points used in a Custom Bidding algorithm to your line items which are using Custom Bidding for optimization.\n\nSo if your current setup is:\n- Sales-Event = conversion-point in your line item\n- Engagement 10\" + Funnel Steps 1-5 + Sales-Event = Custom Bidding conversion-points\n- your line item will have ALL those conversion-points: Engagement 10\" + Funnel Steps 1-5 + Sales-Event\n\nWhy does that matter:\n- Your Total Conversions reported will probably drastically increase (but only for line items which use custom bidding, but not for those who are not, which will be completely confusing in the DV360 UI + Reporting in for example Looker Studio)\n- The CPA will be artificially inflated (drops significantly due to the way higher amount of conversions — that doesn't mean your performance is on fire, that only means your reporting is skewed)\n- You can go to the DV360 reporting tool and filter by Floodlight Activity to get everything right again, but Looker Studio reports will be skewed too, because there is no native connector option that offers that level of granularity, unfortuantely\n\nNext steps:\nCheck your setups if you're using custom bidding and think about what these changes will do to your setup/reporting.",

Google is planning some big improvements for custom\nBidding but the communication from Google has been terrible. Not surprised.",
