      "body": "Depending on your ad spend a month most dsps will offer a full service at no extra cost. You can also look at trade desk resellers since CTV is what you are looking for. I work in the space happy to answer any inventory, bid, PG/deal id questions you have. It also really depends on the 3rd party data you are using to reach an audience or if you are using 1st party data to make lookalikes etc. streaming has FAST, AVOD full stream player. Plus not to mention proving attribution. Most CTV buys are used as an awareness tactic which can prove hard to show attribution. However with the right data partners and more a full funnel approach like retargeting views etc. again in the space happy to chat. Send me a DM anytime.",

I work at a startup where we manage CTV campaigns for media buyers, agencies, and direct clients. We have our own seat at a DSP and work with publishers directly, all that fun stuff. We are not the only one doing this I won't pretend that lol\n\nI don't do sales so I won't mention our company name, but I manage over $1m monthly in CTV spend and would be happy to point you in the right direction! DM if you want to!",

      "body": "Agree with others that there are plenty of very competent and effective managed service programmatic partners who can help. I started out in broadcast/radio/print/OOH also- I know the acronym soup of digital can be overwhelming, but trust me it really isn't all that much more complicated than it is to put together a spot buy with the right Reach & Frequency!  \nThe traditional media companies offering 'streaming' packages are typically just a managed service team sitting on someone else's DSP behind the scenes, but with inadequately trained buyers, traditional media salespeople who don't understand what they are selling, and no transparency on what you're actually buying (and what the fees tacked on actually are). Or they are just outsourcing to a managed vendor and tacking on multiple layers of fees. A managed programmatic vendor who actually specializes in programmatic is what you need. That said, there are plenty of trash vendors who pretend they have technology and make big claims, but operate as black boxes with no transparency and rake huge margins buying garbage. DO ask questions, lots of them, and demand that a partner can provide basic table-stakes like visibility into exactly what inventory you are buying, frequency capping, etc. Also happy to provide advice if you want, feel free to DM!",

      "body": "I totally get where you’re coming from. Streaming can be a headache, especially when vendors aren't clear about their data or performance. I ran into the same frustrations before and realized a lot of it came from using third-party data that didn't give me much visibility.\n\nUsing first-party or people-based data has worked better for me lately. The difference in performance and attribution has been noticeable, but the transparency is what I've found most helpful.\n\nIf you’re feeling stuck, it might be worth looking into platforms that focus on strong 1st-party data and can push it into multiple streaming providers. It really depends on what your clients need, but I’m happy to share more if it helps. Feel free to DM me!",

      "body": "Howdy - I’ve worked in programmatic / streaming for the last 10 years or so. Mostly in client facing / partnership roles. I’m certainly not an “expert” in every facet of the buying experience but I’ve worked with enough clients to have a decent sense of what’s bullshit & what’s not. I’d be happy to chat, if it’s useful!\n\nFWIW - I think it’s pretty commendable you’re taking on more work outside of your JD & I think it will pay dividends over the next few years! Streaming is certainly convoluted & you’re not alone in thinking so.\n\nAlso, in the interest of full disclosure, in my current role I’m building a new division at one of the smart TV OEMs, focused on serving the SMB category / catering to smaller agencies, so I could actually benefit from your feedback as well.",

So I’ve pretty much have been in the CTV side of it all ever since the inception of it. Feel free to PM me. Won’t be a sales pitch at all. I spend a lot of time working with investment and research firms to educate their clients about our industry. I stupidly do it for free, but I enjoy it.",

      "body": "What are your KPI’s? A bit of speculation on my part but it looks to me like your client might be expecting more or less the same KPI from streaming as the other channels you mentioned which isn’t going to happen. Programmatic CTV etc can be a great tool to compliment the existing ones you mentioned by extending the whole campaign reach for CPM’s that are more efficient traditional TV/AV. It might be worth looking at something like buying Amazon Prime inventory through Amazon Advertising Platform - needless to say they have a multitude of  data available, and their videos are non-skip so you will be looking at a more or less 100% VTR. Ran Amazon Prime for one of my clients last year and Amazon provided a brand study which recorded lift (because of course it did) their side. Feel free to reach out by DM if you want some more details. We bought it as a PG deal, which is more or less managed mostly their side. So could be a quick win to get something in the space you want to with your message that performs well, records lift, and doesn’t take a lot of management your side while you take a breather and get to learn a few things while the campaign runs.",
