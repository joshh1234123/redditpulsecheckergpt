      "body": "Why don’t you get paid on PMP? Thats an insane rule. Open exchange I would understand but if you’re setting up a private connection, that’s you driving the revenue.\n\nI would also recommend pricing PMP higher to incentivize reserved inventory at a lower price. Generally it’s tough to convince buyers that need the decisioning power. My only advice is better pricing and insights.",

Otherwise we opt for PMP when possible as we can generally layer our client’s 1P data within platform and optimize to best performing. \n\nDo you have custom content or units you can offer that are only available PG? If you offer PG and PMP for the same inventory, 9/10 times I’m going to opt for PMP so that we can have control of our budget.",

We call it an \"dsp IO\", because it takes away the flexibility where programmatic stands for: real time decisions based on the user and expected KPIs, not a fixed channel or specific publisher. \n\nI would advise to put in DSP reports on deal ID level, then map everything with powerBi or another tool of your choice to an internal deal ID translation sheet. If you only have deals from your partners, you could aim for yearly agreements instead of only based on PGs..",
