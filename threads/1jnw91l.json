At the end of the day, DV360 is similar to any other DSP, so the framework to optimize would be similar to other DSP campaigns. \n\nIf your challenges are purely UI, then you could utilize Google Skillshop to get an overview of the UI.",

Here’s some good resources to help give some foundation understanding. \n\nU of Digital Courses offer a great foundational understanding of ad tech and programmatic media. \n\nThe adTech book by clear code breaks down every part of DSP buying and would give you a good base to work from. \n\nFollow people like Eric Tilbury and Marketecture Media on LI. \n\nYou certainly can utilize Google Skillshop to get an UI understanding of DV360 - it’s not going to teach you how to ‘trade’, but learning how to navigate the UI is half the battle.",
