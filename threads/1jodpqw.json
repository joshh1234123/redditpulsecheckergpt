If someone is more generous than I,  I'll give my upvote.\n\nBayesian don't come without challenges. Typically, if there's no historical data (which is unlikely given all the data one can have access to), the results can be misleading.\n\nAnother concern can be the cost, but again with all the cloud computing one can have access to, it shouldn't be a concern.\n\nBig plus for bayesian is that the optimisation can be done on the go, hence why it's useful not only for AB.",
