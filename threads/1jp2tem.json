I'm smelling from here the amount of crap you'll be buying if you go with whoever promises you CTV without min commitment.\n\n\nLet's be clear: 200K as min is too high. 50K should be reasonable as long as you get extras such as post-campaign reporting with a nice analysis vs linear.\n\n\nOf course it's still possible to buy without any min, but based on your expertise you'll have a hard time choosing the right partners.",

What they gave you is the Fuck You quote because they thought your budget isn't worth their time.\n\nI'm not sure you can get access to that kind of inventory yourself without a DSP seat. Maybe have a look at StackAdapt. \nDoing Youtube through Google Ads on CTV inventory only could be a good alternative. If you're targeting the US, Youtube TV is basically every streaming app.\n\nOr you could be looking up a smaller agency that will gladly manage your CTV buy for a reasonnable fee.",
