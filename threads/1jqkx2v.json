AI models mean fck all without obscene amounts of consistent, clean, reliable and scaled data. Without, the business model breaks down or fails to take off.",

I blame the CEO shareholder panic that causes them all to jump on a trend for a stock bump, without concern if the trend is actually a useful thing for their customers. \n\nWhile I suspect the AI trend will settle this year and we'll start to see the useless AI tools fade away with only a few AI based items remaining, its annoying AF in the meantime.",
