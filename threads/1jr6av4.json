Are you sure the deals you were targeting didn’t just expire at the end of Q1? Maybe there are new Q2 deals available.",

Sounds like poor communication from MSFT regardless. I think your only other programmatic options for NFLX inventory as of now are TTD or DV360. Out of curiosity, are you also buying PrimeVideo via Amazon DSP?",

NFLX had been scaling that relationship back since last year, and I was speculating that OP’s deals disappeared because that sales relationship had formally ended (resulting in new deals needing to be created by NFLX directly).",
