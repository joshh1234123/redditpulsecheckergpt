      "body": "CTR is a dumb metric, especially at that high of %. But if you're really intent on hitting it, target in-app only and set a Minimize CPC bidding algo. Find apps with high CTR and then create a line item targeting only those. You'll be getting only accidental or fraudulent clicks, but hey, you and your client went with the KPI that's been known to be crap for the last 15 years, so what do you expect.",

      "body": "You’re optimizing to **CTR**?\n\nThat’s your first problem. Click-through rate (CTR) is one of the worst metrics to optimize toward in display. It doesn’t measure *value* — it measures *clickiness*. And the most clickable inventory? Usually low-quality stuff like cheap entertainment sites, mobile games with fat-finger clicks, or spammy placements designed to generate accidental taps. Optimizing to CTR often means you’re buying the worst of the internet.\n\nIf your goal is performance (sales, signups, visits, etc.), CTR is a vanity metric. It’s not predictive of downstream action. In fact, studies across multiple DSPs (DV360, TTD, etc.) show that **high CTR rarely correlates with conversions**.\n\nNow let’s talk about your **deal setup**/**inventory.**\n\nYou mentioned this is a *non-guaranteed deal* — that means you're likely getting remnant or auction-based impressions from a curated pool. But if the **deal inventory isn’t top-tier (think either Niche Sites that fit your targeting or things like NYT, WSJ, Disney, etc.)**, then you're just paying more for average or bad supply. A possibility could be inventory provider has probably improved their ad placement to get fewer misclicks so thus fewer clicks?\n\n“But our goal is 1.25% CTR!”\n\nThat sounds like a KPI made up by someone who doesn’t understand how programmatic media works. That’s not a dig at you — it’s extremely common. Most people working in media don’t realize that optimizing display is as much about **supply path quality, identity resolution, frequency control, and outcome alignment** as it is about getting clicks. \n\nAlso, optimization 101. I want more clicks, I was getting that last month. So run a report seeing the difference MoM (Ad format, Sites, Environment, Device) what are the differences - things you can control? if none, then now look at things like did supply placement within the site change, did creative change drastically - things outside your control.",
