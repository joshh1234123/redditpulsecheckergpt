      "body": "Honestly, start to look up things like “programmatic 101” on YouTube to get a high level understanding the the types of tech at play (dsp, ssp etc), different format option (display, olv, CTV etc) and targeting types (behavioral, contextual, lookalike, retargeting etc). There’s a ton more, but I think looking into the above will do a good job of setting g the stage",

      "body": "Getting a solid understanding of the Programmatic ecosystem is a great place to start, since it's the foundation for everything else you'll learn in the industry. There are several helpful visuals and YT videos out there that should help with this! Once you have a sense of the structure and broadly how the ecosystem functions, start diving into platform types in more detail to understand the role they serve and how they work together. \n\nFor example, a good starting point would be to learn about DSPs and how they function in the larger ecosystem with SSPs, DMPs, exchanges etc. Once you have a solid handle on DSPs and generally what they are used for, then that's a good point to begin focusing on certifications for specific platforms (like TTD, DV360). \n\n  \nI'd also suggest focusing on learning different advertising formats (CTV,OLV, Display etc), targeting methods (behavioral, contextual etc) and buying methods (PMPs, open exchange etc) since these are all essentials to understanding Programmatic!",
