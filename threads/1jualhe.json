Since these help with Win Rates and streamlining inventory from Publisher to Advertiser (Programmatic Waterfall), as compared to applying allowlists on the DSP?

It seems like more of a PR thing rather than having genuine care for the environment. Just my experience.",

If the inventory is exclusive or it doesn't scale in the Open Market, it's a different story. But that's normally only a problem for Video/Audio/DOOH, and only very rarely for Display. Also curation is fucked up with additional fees and intransparency, isn't it?\n\nRegarding the carbon emissions - you're right, in most cases performance is more important than a green campaign, but since the logic behind these tools is blocking out domains with attributes I don't like in my campaigns anyway, it's a nice gadget to analyze your domain-list from that perspective + doing something good (and then you can turn off these costs again, when you have a good set of domains + you're might able to build a PR case in addition).",

Few dozens or a handful of high volume domains can already be scaled efficiently if there is not too much specific targeting required or if you have a limited budget anyway. If you're more dependent on niche/themed sites you will probably need more to scale. Also depends on the output imo - good returns allow you to bid more aggressively.
