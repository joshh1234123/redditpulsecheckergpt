(this information could be outdated as it's like 4-5 years old) Google's brand lift study methdology is a bit of a blackbox, they will not disclose all of it, but they will mentioned it's a mix of deterministic and probalistic data \n\n2. Can you confirm the channel you running? Are you running 1p or 3p data?\n\n* 1p data - this one, your pool will be small so may be able to do it 1 time with a certain level of confidence, everytime after, the users in theory would have been exposed \n* 3p data/google data - setup the campaign and set the study live. Try to make sure you're not using the same audiences in other campaigns. \n\n3. Partially. you may not see overall lift, but if you drill through the data you can find potential audiences or opportunities\n\n4. Not really\n\n  \nOverall, any BLS that is 100% digital will have some shortcomings as the way the audience pools are segmented isn't like splitting groups of people, but impressions. Therefore, there are changes the study may reach exposed and \"non-exposed\" users, so keep that in mind. \n\nWhen running a lift study, put all of your questions down (is creative A or B better? is this audience good or bad? etc) if they look silly or not doable. The more you ask, the more you'll be able to identify the value of it (or lack of)",

      "body": "Brand lift studies are exactly what the name says.\nThey measure the lift in certain areas.\n\nThe lift is based on a test and control.\n\nThey work best if you have more spend. And to get the best results you launch the test before the campaign.\n\nOnce they are live they work by showing a questionnaire to people who saw your and and to random people who didn't.\nFor example they ask if you heard about x brand\nAnd there will be some who heard about x brand without seeing the ad for example 5% then you will get maybe 7% of people who heard of your brand but also saw the ad. In this case the brand lift is 2%.\n\nHow to analyze these results is:\nFor every impression you serve there is a 2% chance you will be able to increase awareness of your brand.\n\nThis can be broken down into demographics\nAnd finaly you can see how well certain creatives resonate with certain demographics.\n\nAdditional you could have situations where not many individuals of a certain demographic saw your ad so you push more there.\n\nI dknr recommend optimizing towards brand lift\nBut you can test out marketing effectiveness and creative testing for the same questions you mentioned",

      "body": "1) There's a group of people who got served the ad on YouTube over the past day(s) (exposed) group and a group who've not seen the ad (control). Both groups of people receive the same survey question in the YouTube app before playing a video and YouTube tracks whether people exposed to your ad were actually answering your desired answer more often. This is than translated into a % of lift number based on numbers of people in both groups and the total impressions served by your campaign.\n\n2) Make sure the question you choose is very much aligned with the creative, so don't use a purchase intent question if your ad is more brand awareness based. Outside of that it's recommended to follow YouTube ad best practices. i.e., ensuring the brand is shown before the ad is skippable etc.\n\n3) It's not really possible to use brand lift to optimize in real-time. Insights you get from the dashboard in DV360 are very limited. (demo, device, creative)",

I compared non-skip alpha as control arm vs video for reach as exposed, so basically both arms- IO1 and IO2 are exposed to ads, and DV 360 creates its own holdback control group for the baseline to which both our exposed IOs are compared, which they don't show us in our test result(what's the exact baseline group). I think that  option of selecting control and exposed IO doesn't mean anything, what do you think? Even the Google support doesn't have a clear answer.\n\nHow to find this 5% and 7% people. The test actually gives us the absolute lift right? It's the diifference in positive response of control and exposed group.

So having a control IO for a BLS doesn't make sense.\n\nOn the other hand an AB test represents testing of outcomes where you have 2 different creatives for example.\n\nBLS gives you the lift, the loft is the difference between the exposed group vs non exposed group. For example if you are testing brand awareness there is always going to be % of population who is aware already through different channels.",

Because the survey responses are relatively low, and in case of a lower % lift- there are higher no of survey responses. Hence, certainty is higher due to a much bigger sample size. \n\nThere's a BLS 2 cell AB test in which we run two IO formats and compare them for lift results by setting up a survey question. We're using this to compare different Yt formats for our movie campaigns.",

So the 2% will be more accurate.\n\n\nJust make sure that your IO when you apply the BLS is paused so you can get accurate numbers",
