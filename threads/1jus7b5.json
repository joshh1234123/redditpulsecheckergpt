Whether you're buying open exchange inventory or via PMP/PD deals you get very little transparency beyond domain/app level reporting, as you are dependent on what publishers are passing back through the bidstream. Maybe if you buy via PG with a larger pub you can ask for a series/show level report and if you're lucky they will provide. \n\nYou can also hardly decide which shows/series you buy on, again unless you're buying direct via PG.",
