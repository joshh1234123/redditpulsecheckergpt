There were some past threads on this… not sure I’d even call it a DSP, more like a high margin, non transparent ad network with avg inventory options at best.   I say that because a DSP would offer self service, but DMS is all managed from my experience.   From a performance perspective, again, it depends on how you’re defining performance and who is measuring it.    They will entice with ‘free impressions’, but nothing is free… especially when it lacks transparency.   Long story short, probably better off with TTD or DV360, again pending your goals.",

I’ve used it in the past and some of your comments are spot on. Lack of transparency and them grading their own homework.",
