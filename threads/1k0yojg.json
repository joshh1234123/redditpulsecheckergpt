Well done revenue has skyrocketed.\n\nWhat does an identified user mean? and at what confidence level? and what metric are you trying to move within what bounds?",

How many times do you see a new addressable \"cookieless\" tech being given a massive sales pitch, only for it to either be measured on 1) vanity metrics like CTR / Viewability or 2) a cookie based measurement model, which defeats the whole purpose.\n\nSome of that measurement has to be macro level imo.",
