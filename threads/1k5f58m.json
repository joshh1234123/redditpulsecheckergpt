Like you mentioned, it would definitely be hard to get a job that’s a bit more senior without some hands-on experience in the DSPs.\nAnother option would be to find a similar role at a DSP and transition internally there",

      "body": "My background was SaaS sales. Did it for first 5 years. Fell for the “oh you’ll make good money in your 20s” and it was fine until I got laid off for not even missing quota.\n\nDecided to pivot and actually use my StratComms degree after that and obviously had to use BD to get a foot in the door at my current company.\n\nBut I want to get into the nitty gritty technical “why” and “how” that programmatic offers. I’m not some sales hardo who wants to spend all day trying to set meetings. I’m burnt out of it officially.\n\nHands on keyboard is what I find interesting in this space, and want to proceed accordingly. Was hoping (and still am) my current company would promote me laterally but it’s just not gonna happen it seems",
