      "body": "Wishing you all the best on your job hunt but sorry I'm a little confused. 0.6 months so only 2-3 weeks? Or do you mean 6 months? If you worked in Google Ads for 2 years then that's your 2-3 years right there.\n\nMy humble opinion is that you need to be able to speak to Google Ads as a programmatic tool for display and video. It's not that much different to DV360 or any other DSP - if you understand the similarities/differences and can speak to it then as a hiring manager I could easily consider Google Ads experience as extremely relevant experience for any programmatic jobs.\n\nBut if you yourself don't consider that Google Ads experience relevant or have no way of explaining why it should be considered relevant then the recruiters/hiring managers are not going to make that connection for you.\n\nGood luck!",
