      "body": "Bro as someone who has trained many entry level people in hands on DSP training ....its not something that you can just pick up over a few pointers on reddit: provided you have the overall Digital marketing context down already from your current job, you are basically asking to both be trained in new software AND in the tactical knowledge for how to make decisions along with the information provided by said software.\n\nIf you are serious about this, I would recommend AT LEAST watching some long form/ comprehensive youtube videos on the subject so you see what the major DSP interfaces look like (they all mostly have the same elements in common, just designed differently with things named slightly differently).\n\nIdeally though, i would enroll in a course that has an examination component so you can get a certificate out of the deal (eg. \"https://edgeacademy.thetradedesk.com\"). The major DSPs offer this, though some might cost money nowadays.\n\nIt will not be as good as actual agency/hands on trading experience, but it tells the employer it will be slightly faster to train you since you already have at least the theory down.",
