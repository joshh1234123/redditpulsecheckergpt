There’s a lot of folks with experience waiting tables, etc who have excellent sales skills and separate digital media experience but haven’t been given the opportunity for a formal sales role that combines them. Once I officially had sales on my resume, competitors wanted to recruit me. Honestly — I didn’t learn THAT much at my first sales job. I would’ve been the largely same hire (and cheaper) if they’d taken the leap on me a few years ago.",
