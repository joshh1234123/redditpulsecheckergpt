Sure you can buy inventory in the open market with bidding and without dealing with sales orgs but you have a lot of private inventory, walled gardens and things that more resemble direct IO buys than programmatic even if you use a DSP to finally buy it once you complete the manual buying preparations.\n\nCompare it with the stock market which has truly become programmatic. If you want to buy Apple stock you don’t have to contact a bank and negotiate a bid floor. You just trade it. This how some pioneers of programmatic advertising hoped it would work. But it in many ways it doesn’t work like that. You can start up a campaign and bid a CPM of a million dollars for some publishers in the open market and they wouldn’t even know it, let alone sell it.",

To your 10 years I have 21 years and have planned, bought and sold TV, digital, Gaming and own a programmatic company, not everything is programmatic.

Also, how many times have agencies struggled to deliver budget programmatically or been overworked and understaffed so optimisations don’t happen.

It has everything to do with people doing a job a.k.a. you in this instance that they don’t understand themselves, which is my point here and I would never feel comfortable selling something that I don’t even know myself again, which is the point here… You defending sales people as if I’m not a sales person myself to the client and also a buyer to someone like you or any company selling me anything in the space… I work with sales people every single day of all kinds, I respect sales people, but I also respect human beings in general… If you work at a company that you don’t even know your product that you’re selling that’s are problem in itself let alone the culture and the company itself… This is my entire point\n\nif being direct about a real issue in our industry reads as ‘condescending,’ maybe that says more about how uncomfortable people are with being challenged. You keep circling back to tone, but I’ve been consistent in speaking on misalignment and culture, not individual salespeople. It’s okay to disagree — just be accurate about what you’re disagreeing with.\n\n\nYou called it resume grandstanding lol I call it knowing what I’m talking about. If that makes you uncomfortable, maybe reconsider who you try to correct next time. It’s OK to be wrong.",
