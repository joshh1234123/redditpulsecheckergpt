      "body": "\nYou’re not far off at all, especially coming from a CM360 background — just a few things to clarify:\n\n\n\n\n\t1.\tCampaign level is mainly global settings — yes. It holds flight dates, frequency caps, and some default targeting, but it’s more of a container. The real set up starts at the IO level.\n\t2.\tIOs are where the budget, pacing, and strategy really live. You can override or inherit from the campaign-level settings here. IOs are also how spend is controlled — think of them as the layer where you define the “who/what/where” for each tactic or media type.\n\t3.\tLine items are where execution happens. This is where you select inventory (open exchange, PMPs, PG), apply audiences, geo/demo/device targeting, and assign creatives. It’s not just for grouping assets — it determines where and how your ads actually serve.\n\t4.\tCreatives are uploaded separately and assigned at the line item level — similar to CM360 assets, yeah. But you can control rotation, assign specific creatives to certain deals, etc.\n\nSo overall yes, your structure’s on the right track — just know that DV360 gives you more control and complexity, especially at the line item level. That’s where most of your strategic logic actually lives.",
