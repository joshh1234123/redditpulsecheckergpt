Zeta DSP is the best for ROAS hands down though. Quantcast after that. This is from experience over a decade, managing thousands of campaigns (I’m in sales leadership, not a trader), all performance based, and run across the top 20 DSPs.",

      "body": "Additionally this also feels like someone asking ‘best toolkit for building a deck’ - while the toolkit does matter, most of it relies on your expertise. \n\nBack to programmatic - Yahoo is great for OLV scaling in my experience but prioritizes its own yahoo domains. TTD is obviously industry standard for a reason  if you can swing it, but can suffer from CPM bid bloat due to competition on top of other things. Beeswax ain’t bad, and their customer service team is eager to retain clients. \n\nThere’s a lot of variables. As long as you pick a trusted, known DSP that comes recommended by industry players than everything else is really on how you use it.  Obviously if you are able to get seats on a few top dogs that is best (you’ll learn the quirks and utilize them to your advantage) but that’s expensive. \n\nEverything above is my opinion and experience, others may vary, and I encourage listening to a more opinions and takes",
