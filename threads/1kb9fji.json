      "body": "Thanks for sharing this — it's a great observation and definitely worth digging into. One thing we’d recommend checking is your geo-targeting settings across platforms. Specifically, compare geo delivery data between DV360 and your Flashtalking reports.\n\nIn many cases, Flashtalking will serve a default ad when no other creative is eligible to serve due to targeting constraints. This can happen if, for example, the targeting set in DV360 doesn’t fully align with what's configured in Flashtalking\n\nEnsuring tight alignment between your setup and targeting configurations should help reduce default ad serving.",
