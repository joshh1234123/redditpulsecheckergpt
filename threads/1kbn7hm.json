      "body": "Hi everyone - jumping in on this one too. I've worked as a seller on DSP side and SSP side. \n\nfrom my POV, lots of Independent Agencies and Brands aren't identifying their key strategic media partners, vendors, suppliers, ssp's, data partners, etc. which means they're not unlocking cost savings, discounts, and improved media performance. \n\nsome call this supply path optimization, or spo \n\ni get it. they just don't have the bandwidth to do this.\n\nbut not doing spo could also mean they're running on lower quality inventory, MFA's, higher cpm's, etc. \n\nall that said, i'm wondering if anyone has any recommendations for SPO consulting opportunities? \n\nthanks for your help!",
