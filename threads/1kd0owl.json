I remember messing with some campaigns and it was a nightmare not knowing which channel sucked.\n\nSpeaking of fees, The Trade Desk's tight spot must be rough, especially with Amazon DSP showing them up. If fees keep going down, maybe more folks can play ball in the ad game without breaking the bank.\n\nAlso, if you're into monitoring these wild ad trends, Pulse for Reddit can seriously help keep your finger on the pulse. I've tried different services, but it's perfect for engaging with the Reddit crowd and staying in the loop.",
