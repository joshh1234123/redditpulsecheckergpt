Most of the experience is pure programmatic work. Spent a couple cumulative years doing ad ops, media planning, and AM. Currently more on the client facing side of things for both jobs, but still heavily programmatic related.\n\nBoth jobs are agency side, obviously remote. I don’t keep my situation a secret and the extra work doesn’t affect my output. It works for some people in some roles, for others it’s unrealistic. I’m fortunate to have a good full-time position that pays well and doesn’t care what I do in my free time as long as my work is still producing appropriate value.\n\n  \nEdit:\n\nIn case people actually see this comment, I want to add that I started at $32k out of college. I’m not intrinsically good at any of this, but I’m very good with people and I work hard to become the 2nd smartest person in the room.",
