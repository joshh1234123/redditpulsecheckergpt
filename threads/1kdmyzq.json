      "body": "In Europe we have always on deals in all agency seats from TTD, DV360 to Xandr. Like others have pointed out Netflix is not working with Microsoft anymore. According to our source, Netflix is working on and planned on launching its own Adserver + Tech Stack in July. So makes sense that some of their deals stopped until they launch their own solution. If I would be you, I'd just work my way trough their sales adresses and ask for direct PMPs.\n\nAdding that their overall Sales + Creative approval service is still very bad and not programmatic ready. In europe they take 4-5 days to approve your creative when you first bid.. thats insane!",

You are all correct, they’re no longer using Xandr/MSFT for DIO or PMP/PG deals. \n\nThey’re not on the OE and if you want to buy any 1:1 or 1:many deals you need to have a seat with TTD or DV, or like someone else said, go thru a reseller. And yes, they are working on launching their own ad server, NAS which is built on top of Magnite’s stack.",
