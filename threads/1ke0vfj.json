      "body": "Kinda new to the field but I have personally set up 15s/30s in the same line item itself in previous campaigns. (We weren’t conducting any sort of test for comparing lengths)\n\nYou can always see what the platform is optimizing towards in your reports and pause relevant creatives.\n\nI think keeping the budget unified while seeing what length the platform prefers would give you a better comparison in terms of performance, as opposed to splitting budgets and assessing basis CPM and VCR because 30s might have a slightly lower VCR than the 15s but since they’re both non Skip CTV placements the difference will be negligible. \n\nAs I said I’m kinda new, so please let me know if I’m thinking about this incorrectly too - TIA.",

      "body": "Having them in the same line is fine, but you’ll likely serve more of the 15s so if that’s an issue would be worth manually setting budget. Not run YouTube CTV before but if it’s like standard YouTube am guessing the CPMs on 15s would be cheaper so if your KPI is CPM it’s going to disproportionately choose the 15s from that as well, same as if KPI is VTR.",

      "body": "Yea so completions are a given if you’re running non-skip ad unit. Only instance you won’t get a completion is if user closes content before as finishes or internet drops out lol. I recommend changing IO goal to CPM as the objective seems to be cost efficiency and running non-skips gives you competed views anyway. \n\nNon-Skips are expensive so the 30s will always be more costly than the 15s. With a CPM goal, running both formats within same IO / LI will likely favour the 15s. \n\nYou should try running a Video Reach Campaign with a 15s and 30s non-skip ad lengths optimised towards CPM KPI - is that an option? \n\nAre you running this on DV3 or Google Ads?\n\nBrand Lift not an issue so long as you meet minimum spend threshold which can be found in the help centre.",
