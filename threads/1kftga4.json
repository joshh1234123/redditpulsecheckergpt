      "body": "Depends on where you are at. BUT the biggest difference is usually the amount of hands-on keyboard AND client interaction.  \n\nMost traders have zero client comms and are 100% hands-on. AMs differ depending on where. Some are a combo hands-on and client comms post sale. Some are involved in helping present and inform for client comms but are on the back end.  \n\nI think the big thing is if you want to only be involved on the technical back end side OR if you want to develop client interactions. Both have different tracks for income potential and long-term roles.  \n\nI like a mixture of the two but some people don't ever want to talk to a client.",
