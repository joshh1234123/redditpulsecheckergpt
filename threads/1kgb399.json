      "body": "Given how digital marketing is set to evolve in the next 3-5 years ( AI, growing retail media, CTV etc), a focused degree may not be of much practical use.\n\nIf the goal is to move to a different location, \n- Dubai, Singapore and Berlin have good opportunities and open to hiring people from India for digital marketing.\n- UK , US are harder to move directly. You can try moving within your firm or join companies that allow such transfers ( Google, Amazon definitely do)\n\nIf you want to study further, MBA is a better option just because it give you option to work in various functions ( strategy, client management, product or biz dev). Though the cost would be high, so be conscious of what college/country you choose",

Instead of manual negotiations , programmatic platforms use algorithms to place ads across websites , apps , and platforms - targeting the right user , at the right time with the right message.\n\nIt streamlines the process by using :\n\nReal-time bidding (RTB) - Ads are bought and sold in milliseconds through automated auctions.\n\nData-driven targeting - Advertisers can use audience data(like demographics , interests , behavior) to target more precisely .\n\nEfficiency and scale - Campaigns can run across thousands of sites automatically , reducing manual workload and increase reach .\n\nThis method not only saves time but also improves ad performance by delivering more personalized and relevant ads to users.\n\nIf you want to succeed with programmatic , focus on:\n\n1. clean , verified data\n\n2. Transparent platforms\n\n3. Continuous optimization\n\nIt is one of the most powerful tools in digital advertising  today - when used correctly.",
