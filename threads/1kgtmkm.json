Without going too in depth they have a means of writing your own via (I think) python, and then have a tool where you can weight different site metrics that are floodlights.\n\nHave seen a ton of success with things like:\n1. Stayed on site for 1 min+\n2. Watched a video\n3. Navigated to 2+ additional pages \n4. XYZ\n\n\nWhen I did this last, I worked with internal teams to pull an analysis of what site actions had the highest index with making a purchase/taking the high value action and then used that to base my weights off of.",
