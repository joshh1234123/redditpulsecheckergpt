Googles “targeting” is about as loose as their Broad Match logic in search. \n\nThe exclusion/inclusion settings are in the UI under “Placements”. You can input channel and video URLs. You can copy and paste a lot of them at a time but there is a limit IIRC. \n\nPulling YouTube placement reporting, especially at the video level, is a non-trivial task. Depending on how much budget you’re spending, you may not be able to use excel to look at a manipulate the data. It can easily get above excels storage row limits which means you need to either use a program like Notepad++ which also hits a limit at a certain point, or ingest the data into a database and query it.",

As I have more experience with DV360, I am unsure where all these settings are applied and the level.\n\nYou mentioned under placement, do you mean in the audiences, keywords, and content section of the UI? \nWhere could I exclude any sensitive categories / content level?\n\nThank you so much",
