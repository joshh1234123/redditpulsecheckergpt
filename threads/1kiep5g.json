      "body": "Lucky for you programmatic can 100% be considered performance marketing - it’s just a method of buying ad space. \n\nIf you’re already using google ads and social platforms, then you should have a solid foundation of how data is collected / used in campaigns and real-time-biddable media. \n\nFrom there it’s really getting used to the nuances of all the different platforms and partners because there are so many. \n\nAnyway, I would check out The Trade Desk Academy and see if there are any DV360 trainings on YT.",

Plus think about where the inventory landscape is going.\n\nWe don’t know how companies will classify AI inventory between search vs programmatic yet.",

      "body": "Google DV360 and TTD's Edge Academy should have some free Programmatic and DSP trainings relating to their DSP. Certifications are good I guess, but I'm only ever required to get them once I'm working. As long as you have some familiarity with any platform that is def more valuable.\n\nThe switch into programmatic will be fairly easy, digital media all somewhat is the same, but Programmatic dif throws a few roadblocks and complications, but it should be quicker to pick up with your experience so far.\n\nIn terms of companies, they can be chaotic but I'd look into media agencies or smaller DSP's that do work in programmatic that are remote or India based. GroupM, Havas, all the larger HoldCo's will have entry level roles in India where you can work in programmatic and get experience in multiple DSP's.",
