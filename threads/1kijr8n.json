I can choose teal time mobile ads to pretty much any major us airport without needing to reach out to them.

Not sure what you are advertising and why airport wi-fi feels relevant, but using your strategy you wouldn't hit me or any other traveler I know, so unless you are marketing a VPN for when using crappy public wifi I would rethink.   \nI agree with others, DOOH and geo-fencing sound like much better solutions.   \nYou could also consider United's in-flight and in-app ads, via Magnite- I'm not sure if other airlines have similar programmatic availability. Another angle could be targeted Lyft or Uber ads focused just on airport drop-offs and /or pick ups.",
