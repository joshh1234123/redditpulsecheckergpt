      "body": "I understand where you are coming from, curated deals sound great but often don’t scale as expected. The $50/day issue is usually because buyers are not prioritizing the deals, or there is a mismatch between the audience and available inventory. To make it work, you really need close trader relationships, optimized pricing, and regular feedback from DSPs like TTD or DV360. Otherwise, it’s just not worth the time unless you’re bundling high-value inventory or using it to build long-term partnerships.",

Hence why there are curation houses popping up everywhere now.",

      "body": "Yes, this is likely the reason. The trader has to target your deal specifically, with dedicated budgets. Otherwise, more efficient media supply tends to eat the lion’s share of budget.\n\nThe baseline comparison against which curation’s performance is measured is basically lazy traders who set up a campaign and never touch it. If a savvy media team is running the campaign however, the benefits of curation are highly exaggerated. I have not seen a good rationale for curation when a competent trader is running things and managing audiences, supply, and channel optimization effectively.",
