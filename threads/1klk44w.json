      "body": "Stock exchange isn’t the right word, it would be ad exchange. A listing of prices in the ad exchange would require more centralization of the marketplace like the DOW and Nasdaq centralize the listing of specific equities. As advertising is not an asset, but is at best maybe a commodity, but really not even that, there’s no real value in seeing the price of inventory like you would a stock. A class a share of a company is the same for any purchaser of the equity, an ad impression had dozens of attributes that would make a buy bid up or down on it. It would be like if you were willing to pay more for a share of TTD if it sold on Tuesday between 10-1pm vs less on a Friday between 9-12, and more if it was sold by a M18-34 vs less if it was a M45+. That would make pricing stocks for all buyers very difficult, hence ads are more complex. \n\nAnd even if you solve for that, the publishers would never ever allow it anyways",
