      "body": "There are a LOT of tools out there! Couple of questions to get more context:\n\n1. In terms of channels, sounds like you need the main ones + programmatic channels, right?\n2. What are your requirements from an insights perspective? Is a high-level cross-channel overview enough, or do you also want to dig into keywords, creatives, etc?\n3. Do you have any backend or attribution data you need to join with channel data? Or do you just need channel data?\n\nIf you just need high-level cross-channel reporting, without any attribution or backend data, I'd recommend Supermetrics and Funnel\n\nIf you also need more granular insights (creatives, keywords, etc) and need to join backend/attribution data, I'd recommend Clarisights",

      "body": "For scaling programmatic and cross-channel reporting, the modern approach is to decouple data integration from visualization. Use a robust ELT connector to pull data from The Trade Desk, Google, Meta into a warehouse like BigQuery or Snowflake, then connect a BI tool (Looker Studio, Power BI) for dashboards. Tools like Windsor.ai, Fivetran, Stitch and Airbyte handle connectors reliably.",
