Will they be operating under a single ads.txt entry soon?\n\nI wanted to reach out to them as a publisher, but their contact form returns an error—maybe it’s already been disabled.\n\nAlso, is it possible to narrow your ads.txt list down to a specific region? I'm particularly interested in the EMEA market.",

      "body": "Hi u/gordriver_berserker ,  Thank you!  As of now, Equativ and Sharethrough have not merged their operations under a single ads.txt entry or unified server. Since their merger on June 12, 2024, both continue to operate with separate ads.txt lines.  \nThat said, they may request a single ads.txt line, likely under Sharethrough for new publisher onboardings.  \n  \nHowever, this probably won’t impact publishers already integrated. Moving forward, it’s likely they’ll operate under a single Sharethrough line, as Sharethrough is the parent company.  \n  \nSo far, our seller's report has focused on U.S. publishers and SSPs, but in the future, we plan to extend our ads.txt insights to cover EMEA region as well. :)",
