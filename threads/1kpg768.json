      "body": "Curious on your take as to why ssps are all in decline? From a casual observation, i see publishers are consolidating inventory along with their audience data and ready to monetize away. This is what i think Netflix, Spotify, Microsoft (esp this one) are all  keen on doing, which is build out their proprietary SSP and sell their inventory via programmatic deals. I also think this is why MSFT doubled down on their Monetize acquisition in favor of sunsetting the Invest DSP.\n\nThanks for your thoughts",
