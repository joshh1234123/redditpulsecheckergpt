      "body": "Not to sound dismissive, but 1 milli is spent a month by big agency traders. So I wouldn't flag it as a major thing, makes you look inexperienced. \n\nWhen it comes to foreigners. I would start to look at agencies that have offices in Brazil, from then on it would be easier to pivot outside the country. \n\nAlso, I would say that social media ads is, maybe, the most crowded side of media buying (since the entry level barrier is pretty much none compared to other platforms), maybe try looking into official courses from Google (either Google ads or programmatic) and TTD (super good for CTV). \n\nThat being said, from time to time European based agencies might hire people from all over the world due to timezone difference",

Yes companies go this route for efficiency in cost. Your salary can easily pay 4 campaign managers  , well versed. Big companies prefer to outsource this because again , it’s naive to think that a company will sponsor you from latam as a campaign manager just because they are not able to find someone in the us which is not true.",
