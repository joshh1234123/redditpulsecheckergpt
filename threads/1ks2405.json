      "body": "Couple of options. Through the Trade Desk and others, you can target live soccer by channel or by a specific deal. Depending on the country it is relatively easy. The biggest key is actually setting the CPMs high enough as this would be an expensive buy.  \n\nYou can also try and get shoulder coverage (less expensive) that would target the soccer shows before and after games.   \n\nSo talk to your DSP of choice OR CTV buying agency and you can get it done fairly simply. I can hook you up with one of our sales people BUT if you already have a DSP seat just ask them for EPL coverage CPMs and options.   \n\nHonestly- it would be much more cost effective to target EPL watchers WHO are relevant to your brand with CTV and other tactics. Blanket target EPL would probably not be as effective as targeting the right audience. But it depends on what you are doing and your brand.",
