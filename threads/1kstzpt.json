You will also have to think about the UI challenge - does each integration have their own set of screens (more maintenance) or share the same screens (more consideration for compatibility)\n\nBased on your list, I’d avoid create and editing campaigns and ad groups beyond simpler use cases, like budget management.  Once get to ad groups, each platform describes the same feature differently.  These features are also most likely to change over time.  This may lead to breaking changes, and people will just go back to the platform.\n\nWhen thinking about reporting integrations, you’ll want to think about your data model.  It’s tempting to just grab all the data you want and dump it into one table, but that will result in longer processing times and user frustration.  \n\nTackling budget management, pause/resume campaigns, automating campaign shell creation (name/budget), assigning creatives, and actionable insights (e.g. ad group A is driving a lower CPA, shift more budget here) are good initial use cases, and touch features that are usually stable and mature.",

What was complicated for me was each system's object hierarchy and how they weren't always a 1:1 system - makes it tough to specifically make a single dashboard that was platform-agnostic.\n\nI'd recommend at least starting out with something super simple - activating and pausing campaigns, adding budgets are great use cases.\n\nAlso another thing I'd recommend is poring over the API documentation. I actually found certain reporting features in Xandr's API that weren't available in the UI that were immensely useful for me and my team.",
