      "body": "Are you looking to run self serve or managed service? Choozle may be fine (though thats another layer taking a cut of your media budget). Either way you should seriously vet capabilities to target by titles that you need...Most of these guys are going to suggest you tap into behavioral data from something like Bombora....which can be very meh, since it's heavily reliant on content the user is looking at opposed to who they actually are (ie: someone looking at IT content, may not even work in IT). Depending on who you're trying to reach and how (title based or account based), be sure they have the capability fit and can coherently tell you how it works. \n\n  \nAlso set your expectations low for Programmatic...it's not going to be a lead driver, but if you understand that and are measuring the effectiveness of your other channels after implementing it, you'll do fine. $5K a month is plenty enough for testing in B2B (you might not be hitting your whole ICP), but anyone who tries to suggest more than that is sus.",

      "body": "For $5k a month- I'd look into StackAdapt for ease of use. JUST make sure to do a really good amount of domain and tech guardrails when setting it up. Remove categories like App game, App communication, most apps in general. And do an initial domain cull after the first few weeks. As all programmatic auto pushes towards cheaper inventory.  \n\nWhat is your contract size like? $5k a month is a small amount for programmatic. BUT with that you can target CRM lists, retarget website visitors, etc. A good way to use that smaller budget is to augment your sales staff. Taking lead lists and current deals in the works and targeting the leads from those. Or piggybacking off of email marketing by target email lists with display ads.  \n\nAnother thing is to not really worry about frequency as IT folks will need to see that ads 10-30 times before engaging.  \n\nI have worked on a lot of IT based B2B saas and it works really well most of the time. Just have patience. Also- audio ads tend to work well with IT and engineers. As they engage a lot more podcasts and streaming than average AND there are no ad blockers.",
