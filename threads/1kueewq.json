Don't complain about working hours.   \n3. Fill in all your timesheets and documents on time.    \n4. Deliver last click ROI from YouTube CTV. \n\nIt's a bad market at the moment, so it's not about you. Let's see where this goes in a year from now.",

      "body": "Feels like they are giving generic reasons rather than anything I would take too personally.\n\nThere are lots of applicants for open roles so the reality is that there was likely just a \"better candidate\" in these cases (probably just someone with a bit more experience).\n\nI would recommend being more specific on your strengths if you are getting this question a lot in interviews and add an example to demonstrate it. Otherwise it's hard for interviewers to distinguish you from other candidates and if you're just trying to say the right thing.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you need any advice on CV or interview prep and I'll see if I can help!",

I don’t work on strategy roles but for AM roles definitely showing client facing skills in an interview is crucial. \n\nYou have to remember they very likely know the set of clients you will be working with so they will be assessing you as a fit for them. Problem solving skills is also important. \n\nIt’s tough out there at the moment and a lot of client seem to be giving baseless feedback also which is really frustrating. Best of luck with it all!",

Currently, the job market is bad, the market is bad, so you are competing with people who have been made redundant from Meta, Google, Big4 consultants, while WPP is shrinking, S4 share is 84% down, and there is a trade war in process. Even worse for me, I left London so I have no chances.",
