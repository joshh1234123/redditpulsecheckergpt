And, are you looking to go client-side, agency-side, etc.\n\nWhile programmatic roles tend to have a little more viability than strictly direct experience, agencies these days will be looking for specific skills/experience at more senior levels and a track record that you have familiarity with DSPs because the resources needed to catch someone up looking for a role past a manager-type level is not going to be worth the hand holding and training needed. Particularly because you'll be asked to provide guidance for a team that reports into you, to contribute to POVs and keep all the fires from getting out of control as scope creep is insane.\n\nIf you're looking for a role that's generally 2-3 years of experience needed, then there's more flexibility. Associate Director and above you might find more successful applying to supply side SSPs or even the DSPs, or a managed service type programmatic operation like an MIQ or Zeta where you can further get closer to getting the direct experience needed.",

      "body": "Absolutely! Pay close attention to campaign set up, targets, audience segments, and the attributes you want to target. Then think about the channels they will be reached in. Every channel you effectively reach them in lowers the cpa by 14% (increases cost of course) but also decreases the cost per household reach by 21%. \n\nYou have all the right bones set up- the optimizations are being taken over by Koa, KoKai (TTD), viant’s algo, and basis is set to launch something similar to keep up. Even if you just played around with the limited stackadapt, you’d still be able to outperform a lot of the in-house marTech teams out there.",
