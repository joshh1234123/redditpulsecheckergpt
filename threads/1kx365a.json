      "body": "that's pretty broad question, let me know if the below helps ya\n\n* DV360: Google stack, access to exclusive inventory, easy interface\n* TTD: nimbler, more robust featues and more pieces to move around \n   * Kokai is fucking with some of the good aspects of TTD, but for most of it ttd gives you a higher flexibility\n\nTTD will have more costing involved as it doesn't have many proprietary things like Google does (i.e. data is \"free\" on dv360), however, I found TTD gives better return on outcomes. \n\n  \nPersonally, I'd consider all the DSPs in our industry as cars - if you drove one, you probably can drive most of them. There'll be difference (Toyota vs Nissan), however, for most of it, as long as you have a strong foundation, you should be able to pick any DSP and be comfortable to handle it within 2 weeks (given you have enough time to sit down)",

      "body": "Not saying you are going to do this, but I personally wouldn't try to convince them you have a bunch of experience in TTD if you don't. I would just focus on your experience in premium DSP's in general, your understanding around the concepts of programmatic trading, and how adept you are at picking up new software and interfaces quickly. \n\nPremium DSP's really aren't all that different. You knowing principles around audience building, optimization strategies, analyzing performance, etc are more important than knowing how to navigate to the audience builder tool.",

      "body": "Google is building its walled garden, which means it will always prioritize publishers that use Google’s SSP and Ad Manager. You can easily observe this by generating a report using the relevant dimension. I don’t necessarily think this is a bad thing, as cookie matching tends to be much more effective within a closed system than when trying to match across different tech vendors. The data loss in such cases can be significant.  \n  \nTTD, on the other hand, is closer to being seen as an unbiased DSP, since it doesn’t own any SSP. That said, you may see better performance on publishers that are not tied to Google’s tech stack.   \n  \nI’m not sure how open Google is to supporting alternative IDs, but TTD has been at the forefront of adopting this technology and has focused on deterministic data.",
