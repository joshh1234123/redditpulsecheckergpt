      "body": "Depends where you want to end up. I’d say take your ad ops skills and get into a campaign management role where you’re running campaigns, helping with pre-sales, escalating to engineering, developing new solutions to problems, refining processes, etc. All of that becomes transferable to tech companies in general \n\nAn ad tech vendor is your best bet for this experience, but if you don’t want to leave your company, see about getting involved with other teams and learn the full picture of the industry. \n\nAll that being said, it really depends on where you want to go. Technical side or sales/account side. My advice is don’t look at ad ops as your final career stop, it’s the starting point and you need to turn it into something else otherwise you risk getting outsourced later on",

A lot of vague things too, since like you, they were one off roles.\n\nI ended up just learning it’s best to bounce around for better roles with more specific descriptions. Good indicator that someone there does know what they need and can actually teach you things.\n\nOtherwise, if you really would rather learn yourself, SEM and programmatic are the other pieces of that ops funnel you’d pick up on easily. I did programmatic and that is my main focus/job now :)",
