      "body": "It depends on what you're buying. For example, you can only buy YouTube on DV360, Amazon Prime Video/Twitch on Amazon DSP, LinkedIn audiences on Microsoft DSP.\n\nFor \"regular\" buys not involving any of those exclusive inventory, DV360 is the most user-friendly under my POV, so I would simply stick to it. Easier to negotiate deals, configure creatives, build campaigns and visually better to understand what's working/not working and troubleshoot. Not to mention that the Google help center has answers for 99% of what you'll need to know. \n\nThen you have smaller DSPs such as Basis etc. Smaller agencies will rely on them due to costs, generally not user friendly.",

      "body": "It depends on attribution and strategy in my opinion. It’s a lot harder to understand channel incrementally via lift testing when your buy is spread across different DSPs. I do get the competitive pricing comments others have made, but I also think this can be executed through regular RFP processes/good negotiation. Personally I find programmatic buying more transparent when executed outside of walled gardens like Google/DV360, but that’s only my personal experience having worked across agencies and brands. \n\nI recommend reading up from industry sources like Adlytics & others for some inventory red flags as well when navigating the selection process.",
