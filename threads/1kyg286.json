      "body": "If they ask if you do social or traditional just say yes - trust me. It’s not hard, it’s the same process, anyone saying otherwise is lying. Literally doing the same job, posting ads toward an audience and reporting/optimizing on it. I would say if you can do DV you can handle social lol. \n\nTry digital media specialist or media planning - good roles that you’d fit.\n\nAfter working 5 years fully remote i transitioned to a place that does hybrid. It’s fine, i like talking to people one on one, tapping a shoulder and not waiting a few hours for a response, and they usually just let me leave when i am done. Imo it’s more to make sure you are present than anything, like not working a separate job. You’d be fine it’s not really different.\n\n\nJust make sure you like who you interview with because with hybrid you will be with them lol.",

There are some rules about not allowed content and some restricted content but programmatic has the same. \nGoogle is a bit different but overall buildup is the same, just that you have to handle keywords. Searching and validating them needs some tools and time but nothing too difficult.  \nThey say that LinkedIn ads are expensive. You need like 30€-100€ per day minimum. Is that expensive? In return you have very specific segments of people.   \nEmail marketing is some black magic shit but if you have your (double consent) list together then it’s just a lot of testing and resilance and timing your emails. Half a brain could do that.  \n\nI mean if you’ve ran and set up programmatic campaigns with hundreds of LI’s over tens of geos and delivered results then social is like a vacation for your brain with only worry that it’s too slow to react.",
