So that will be limited. They also call themselves Ad manager and not a DSP as they don't have full capability of a DSP.",

It’s for clients and people that are not ready for true programmatic advertising yet either because of resource constraints, budgets and so on.\n\nThat’s not to say it’s bad, I run it a lot, it performs well in addition to standard dsp buying.",
