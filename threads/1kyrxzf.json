I doubt they are looking to attribute lower-funnel results to their awareness campaigns. You don’t need any additional software to prove your worth. Ask them to define what metrics are used to judge the performance of your campaigns.",

      "body": "I agree with previous voices:\nSeems like the scale & complexity (low) of the business and media does not warrant use of advanced (& expensive!) analytics like marketing mix modeling or even multi-touch attrib.\n\nYou should have a clear agreement with your key stakeholders on what metrics you want to drive though.\n\nWhat I would also suggest is to monitor (but not necessarily commit) certain metrics, which SHOULD have a relationship with effective upper funnel activity.\nFor example: when awareness grows - you'd expect more website traffic from search - esp. Brand keywords. Perhaps even Direct. You can easily monitor this in G.Analytics and correlate with upper funnel.\nSame goes for other metrics: your CPA (lower funnel) should be gradually becoming lower, more effective - as a result of built awareness and recognition. \nYou may also agree to have some % of your overall performance to be measured by overall company success (sales, revenue) - to reflect your influence on it, but also the fact the influence is somewhat indirect.\n\nHope it makes sense.\nFingers crossed!",

I've worked in similar setups where teams were hesitant to stray from last-touch models. Bridges were built by presenting clear, easily digestible data from simple A/B tests. While things like Meta or Google ads can provide insights here, exploring other tools could be useful.\n\nFor upper-funnel engagement tracking, I've heard folks have success with Campaign Monitor due to its straightforward reporting. Pulse for Reddit could also be nifty, as it’s great for engaging with target audiences and aligning with organic strategies. And of course, pay attention to the overall budget allotment, ensuring any tool adoption doesn’t overextend financially.",
