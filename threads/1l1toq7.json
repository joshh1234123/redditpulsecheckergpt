      "body": "Based on my experience, a DSP generally respects the frequency cap. I have used Google Display & Video 360 and Quantcast, and I don’t recall encountering any significant issues with frequency management. If a bid request lacks a cookie ID or if it cannot be determined whether an impression has already been served to that cookie, the DSP simply won’t bid.\n\nHowever, certain websites categorized as **MFA (Made for Advertising)** often fail to respect frequency caps. To address this, I would run a report to identify any websites showing an unusual frequency. Additionally, I would analyze the data by exchange, as there might be one or more exchanges where bid requests are of lower quality. Furthermore, I would track whether the frequency has increased starting from a specific point in time; if so, I would check if any settings were modified at that moment.",
