You can also target based on Gender and Age (Males ages 35+). Get a read on performance & engagements. Then maybe consider 3P targeting, which will be more expensive.",

But the data is in some of the DSPs out there.  \n\nThe question always comes down to budget and goal. Are you trying to reach semi-truck owner/operators? Commercial diesel truck owners? Or personal diesel vehicles? All are doable. It aint hard. Programmatic allows for you to target real niche audiences. Depending on your product and creative- ROI can be real tricky.",

For your example, there are ways to reach diesel truck owners in Canada through audience segments, behavioral targeting, or custom data onboarding via a DSP. It’s not magic, but with the right platform, your ads can appear only to that niche.",

      "body": "^^^ THIS\nFull disclaimer - I work in an adtech company.\nWhat I'm about to say is hopefully helpful regardless.\nWe try to educate Clients that the issue with 3rd party data is lack of transparency. Somewhere & sometime - all segments HAD a decent \"signal\" as an origin (like in the example above: \"person X bought a diesel truck\"). The issue is - such segments are super tiny and data vendors want to scale them (to sell them and make money), so such data (called \"deterministic\") is than applied to other persons, whi exhibit *some* similarity to original data-set. Now we have \"probabilistic\" data... and it usually SUCKS, but you are never told, what's truly inside.\n\nNow...\n\nThe way around it is to use simpler signals, but ones which are less likely to be modeled that way.\nFor your case - a few examples below. Not sure how good they are - your industry is really outside my expertise, so take it with a grain of salt.\n\na) geo-based signals. If diesel truck owners have specific behaviors - like regularly stopping on trucker gas/rest stations - you can target people who inherit ARE in such place (geofencing) or people who have been in such places (will be less precise, but better scale).\n\nb) targeting based on interests and intents - ideally based not on black-box 3rd party segments, but CONTENT, which such truckers likely 'consume'. Disclosure - this is the solution company I work with excellent at, so again - take it as it is).\nFor example: if you know your audience and are convinced that they regularly read about... portable camping equipment (IDK, I really have no idea...) - you can reach them with contextual solution - reaching people who interact(ed) with such content [interest or purchase intent]. This can be anything, of course. Perhaps due to loneliness, they often read about dogs. Or maybe about satellite phones. Or maybe they are avid barbecue/ grill lovers. You probably know, or can find out.\nWhen you do - target them based on their interests.\n\nc) lastly - perhaps this is a good case for some simple partnerships. Find someone who has a business NOT competing with yours, but is interested in the same audience. Do something together. Joint offer? Use each other's channel for promotion. Recommend each other's offer some discounts or benefits.\nI know - it's not programmatic. Old school, but certainly worth a try.",
