      "body": "Oh boy, I love when people post about Amazon DSP. Amazon is legitimately the biggest piece of shit from an ad tech perspective. Their reporting is an absolute joke and there is literally not a single reason to use their DSP unless you want to buy Amazon O&O. Their Commerce search is even worse: people that sell on Amazon almost always barely break even with how much Amazon’s take rate is.\n\nTLDR, their tech, their UI, and their rates suck, good luck getting a single useful thing from reporting, and if you want to buy media against literally anything outside of their O&O inventory (which again is pretty fuckin trash), use any other DSP. \n\nSource: I worked in commerce search on Amazon in both prog and search (sponsored products and sponsored brands) very recently and lasted 5 months in that role because the Amazon DSP was such a piece of shit to use and our Amazon team was maybe the worst client service team I have ever experienced in my career. Good luck working with them.",

Amazon Marketing Cloud has some interesting reporting and clean room capabilities if you have the data analytics practice to make use of it. The platform is buggy, clunky budget management and horrendous inventory curation. There also aren’t many options for refining optimizations sub line item. Line items also can only control spend with lifetime budgets, regardless of campaign flighting settings. We constantly run into bugs, bulk uploads that don’t make the changes they’re supposed to, etc. The reps are similarly useless as Google reps, don’t know anything you ask and present stuff you’d never ask for. Fees aren’t too bad, but you also get jack shit to work with. I’d opt for a 2nd tier DSP than work with them for any non-endemic client.",
