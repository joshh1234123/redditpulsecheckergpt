      "body": "Look up “traffic shaping” for further explanation. A lot of the reduction in bid requests happens at the SSP level. The DSP team responsible for the integration with the SSP will have the ability set to the level of bid requests they accept from that SSP. So, the publisher may send 1 million request to the SSP, then the SSP might only send 10k of those to the DSP.\n\nIf you’re wondering if supply/pub-side targeting is a good idea, the answer is yes. It is helpful for the supplier of the deal to align with your desired targeting, so a higher percentage of the bid requests being surfaced to the DSP have a good chance of being bid on.",
