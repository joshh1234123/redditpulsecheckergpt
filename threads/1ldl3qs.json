Yes, but it may not scale | wmt dsp i haven’t tried yet \nCan you buy with a pg? Not 100% but leaning towards no | same as the pmp answer for wmt dsp\n\n(The above doesn’t necessarily applies to amazon but the other retailers)",

      "body": "Currently working with Amazon DSP as main DSP here.  \nFor endemic advertisers we usually use retail data (custom asin-based audiences) to convey traffic on brand stores or PDP on PMP and Open exchanges. i highly recommend using Amazon Publisher Direct as inventory to increase audience match rate.   \n  \nFor non-endemic you can leverage both In-Market and Lifestyle audiences but not custom build asin-based audiences. Also verify with you AMZ representative if your advertiser has some restriction on IM audiences targeting.\n\nUnfortunately Programmatic Guaranteed via ADSP does not support audience targeting at Line item level. You can still use Amazon shopper data when your PG deal is created from Amazon.",
