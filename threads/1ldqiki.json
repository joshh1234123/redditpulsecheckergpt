      "body": "\\- Yes LI level for pre-bid and it comes as \"3P Fees\" in the invoice. Depends on your targeting if it impacts pacing or not.  \n\\- Amazon is pretty limited for brand safety in comparison to other DSPs, so you either go all in on 3P (if you trust it) or do more post bid\n\n\\- If you are non-endemic (serving ads to a destination off Amazon), yes you can wrap tags with 3P verification but there is no Campaign Automator approach yet that DV360 / TTD has for example if you are using CM360 as an adserver. Endemic you can wrap tags manually (painful) but is monitoring only no blocking.\n\n\\- Sure though I wouldn't go so narrow. And audience data powered by Amazon can range in CPM from $0.50 to over $2\n\nWatch out for viewability on Amazon O&O itself, it can be pretty terrible sometimes.",

      "body": "Working on an EU Amazon focused agency here so main focus is on O&O inventory with limited delivery on 3p inventory but maybe i can help:\n\nWe usually do not use pre-bid custom segments on 3p inventory apart from some contextual segments but that's situational in my case. However i never experienced pacing issue related to that setting.\n\nIn my experience  ADSP built-in brand safety filters work just fine but that depends on your advertisers preference i guess.\n\nAFAIK post bid measurement relies on wrapped tags but if you're interested i can verify that.\n\nYou can combine demo and shopper data for audience targeting. I personally prefer relying only on shopper data as usually accounts are shared among multiple users and it may not be precise enough.",

      "body": "There are pre-bid options (like Double Verify), like others  said with fees broken out in reporting as 3P fees.\n\nRecently they've launched inventory groups which is a good way to focus on private marketplace supply without having to set up individual PMP deals. You can target categories of deals (e.g. Verticals, RON etc.) to improve supply quality rather than relying on open exchange.\n\nAlso they have goal-based bidding options to auto-optimise to awareness metrics like reach, target frequency or viewable reach. Also Performance+ for ROAS optimization.\n\nAudience targeting: you can use AND / OR logic to include or exclude multiple audience groups. There is a forecast widget to give you est. impressions etc. but sometimes doesn't work great for niche layering.\n\nReporting can be slow, but the platform UI is better than it was for when you need to review pacing / inflight performance.",

      "body": "Thank you for responding so clearly, this has been really helpful. Are there any additional fees for shopper data?\n\nSince you already work with this DSP, can I ask about their bidding capabilities:\n- Do they only support standard bid types, or do they offer any form of custom bidding?\n- Have you been able to use custom algorithms or integrate external solutions like Scibids?\n- I’m also curious how their bid rates and win rates compare when accessing similar inventory across other DSPs.\n-,Do they offer any AI-powered bidding features, similar to Predictive Clearing in The Trade Desk?\n- Finally, has their reporting improved? Last time I worked with them, which is quite awhile, there were some limitations..",

      "body": "Happy to help.  \nYes Amazon charges a fixed cpm fee for shopper data, however should you include multiple audiences with different pricing only the highest fee will be charged.\n\nLately some bids modifiers have been added on the platform, unfortunately those are no UI accessible but you should upload a xls template.\n\nAFAIK you cannot integrate extrnal solutions such as scibids.  \n  \nUnfortunately i'm not able to compare Amazon DSP to other DSP on the same inventory.  \n  \nThere is some form of AI driven algorithm on Amazon DSP (perfromance plus) that works both endemically (trying to push sales on Amazon) and non-endemically (on tagged conversion points provided you are above a certain event number on a timerange)\n\nAs far as reporting is concerned i never had any complaints on the reporting and all information i need are there. API reporting is a little more complete in terms of metrics.  \nThere's still a lot that can be improved IMO but i saw a big improvement on the platform in the last 4 years",
