      "body": "Depends a lot on budget. Click to call is a really weird one. As it can work but its also a really difficult one to run well. Mainly because calling is not a first or easy action people take. I hate calling anyone for anything... hah.  \n\nBut if you have the right audience and product type- it can be a good measurement. But if your goal is to get people to call - you should invest in PPC more.  \n\nIf you do go click to call in programmatic- I would suggest using it as a secondary conversion goal vs primary. If you have a huge budget- then feel free. But the amount of people who have asked me for click to call campaigns at a low budget is really high.",
