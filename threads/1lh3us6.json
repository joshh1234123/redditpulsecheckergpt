If I go with clicks as the objective, would that be better for Demand Gen, considering we can't have floodlights? Which KPI would drive more clicks and give better tracking for YouTube landing URL clicks—CTR or CPC? Currently we're considering CTR.",

We are thinking of switching to clicks with the impressions CTR as our KPI. How would this work out? Since you are using Clicks and CPC w/o floodlights, is there a loss in tracking clicks?
