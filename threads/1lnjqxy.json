      "body": "For a more affordable option, [Simpli.fi](http://Simpli.fi) is a solid indie DSP with a strong focus on location-based targeting. It allows for custom polygon creation to track and optimize store visit attribution. You can build audiences based on historical visitors to your own stores or competitor locations, all without needing a separate third-party location data partner. They use GPS and plat line data alongside geofencing tech, which makes it easy to activate proximity-based campaigns with built-in visit tracking.\n\nIf you're open to higher platform and data fees, The Trade Desk (TTD) recently rolled out its own geofencing solution through Kokai. While TTD doesn't offer deep native geofencing capabilities, it integrates with nearly every major location data provider, including PlaceIQ, Foursquare, InMarket, AdSquare, and more, through its Measurement Marketplace. It also provides access to real-time and post-campaign footfall attribution depending on the location data provider. TTD has superior inventory access, particularly with the Kokai focus on inventory quality, though most major DSPs generally tap into the same SSPs. If you go this route, it becomes less about TTD itself and more about the location data partners you choose, so I’d recommend scorecarding those providers based on your own criteria to ensure alignment with your goals.",

So my advice would be to run the operation from GCP to secure and segment traffic and hire some type of GPS data party service or distributor.",
