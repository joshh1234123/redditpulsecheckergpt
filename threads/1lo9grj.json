Custom more curated pre-bid requiring working with the 3rd party who will create a custom ID for you and push it to the DSP seat to use. The latter is x3 more expensive normally.",

If you need to decision on some unique attributes at the prebid layer it's possible but you'll need both the dataset and the prebid server to actually leverage the data.",
