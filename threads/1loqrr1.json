Consider a move to an adtech company, but in a partnerships, product manager or business development role. Depending on the company and the exact responsibilities, these can vary across company, they should give you skills that easily translate to similar roles at any company/industry. The benefit of that being that you don't have to take a lateral step, or even a step back when transitioning into an entirely new field as you leverage your programmatic skills and experience first to develop yourself in more general skills",
