Which would be be a better investment for their services.\n\n\nIn stock market sense, a poll on reddit in Programmatic is not going to give you any real sense, there is so much more going on with these companies and what might impact their stock price, and I presume the descions between them aren't being made by an average redditor.\n\n\nBesides as you can see in your results this is the sort of place people are skeptical of the 'big players' but the reality is a lot of big companies are going to be picking between them.",

Wanted to float a reddit poll out there just to see what actual customers thought about the products for supplemental analysis. Seems to me like this industry is more likely to go to 0 than have a significant pop in share price.",
