      "body": "AI shines at grunt work but hasn’t replaced a good trader yet. I’m using Adverity to auto-pull log-level files, feed them into a GPT macro that spits out pacing and anomaly alerts before coffee. Claravine plus a simple Python script handles our naming conventions-drop the IO details in a sheet, press run, and every placement name matches the taxonomy. Mosaic sits on top when we need to test new conversational ad formats; it predicts intent off chat transcripts and pushes creative variants back into DV360 with almost no manual tagging. The trick is documenting savings in hours, then pitching management on reinvesting that time into strategy instead of head-count cuts. Use it to ditch the grunt work, not replace your seat.",
