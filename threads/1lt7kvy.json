      "body": "Yeah. It's a scamtech company. They put up paper thin protections against click fraud/crooks and then cover up the reports of it. This type of stuff has been going on since day 1 with these scamtech companies.\n\nNo reasonable person thinks that the advertising marketplace would be run like a scam factory if there was reasonable competition.\n\nCompanies like Google and Meta have created an environment where nobody wants their advertising products, but they own the whole market so you what are you suppose to do? They've fabricated this totally fake story about how they're \"just the innocent companies that happened to end up with a situation where the whole marketplace is funneling through them. Wow, how did that happened? It must have been an accident... Who knew?\" /eyeroll\n\nThey've hijacked the entire market place and turned it into an always lose casino that they're the house of. It's time for change. It really is.\n\nSeriously: If you walked into a casino and they said the house advantage was 40%, you would walk out instantly. Yet, people line up all day long to give money to Google, happily paying a totally uncessary 40% fee that they wouldn't have to pay if they went direct. A standard fee structure would put their fee at a reasonable 10-15% not 40%+...\n\nI don't know, why is Google just raking in money? Why are people willing to overpay, so incredibly badly because \"it's Google?\"",

      "body": "Even with an inclusion list, if a channel is putting up this kind of content and pulling it down and re-editing it before you run the reports, you’d still be running ads on placements that violate YT policy and should not be monetized to begin with. My take from the findings in this report is brand safety is technically impossible to achieve on YT with the current platform capabilities.",
