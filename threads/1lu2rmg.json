However, as a publisher, this doesn't bring any value. You also need to add a back button somewhere to go back to domain entry otherwise the page gets stuck on the metrics.",

That way, you can see output way more accurate.\n\nAlso, thanks for flagging the back button issue, will work on making it smoother.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to hear more about your workflow and what would make the tool genuinely useful for you. Would you be up for a quick call to share your feedback? **We also offer deeper audits that factor in more variables, if that’s something you’d be interested in.**\n\nJust grab a slot whenever it suits you- [https://calendly.com/hello-db/30min](https://calendly.com/hello-db/30min)",
