StackAdapt can be solid for smaller budgets if you work to control inventory and increase CPMs.  \n\nYou also might want to look for an agency that has a good programmatic team. We sell to a lot of creative and social focused agencies. Just outsourcing their CTV buys. Since we use a few partners at scale, the pricing and CPMs are on par with SA and others but the inventory access is greater.   \n\nDIY is great and all but its also good to lean on experienced buyers who know their stuff.",

They aren’t TTD, DV, or amazon, but our clients are local or regional brands and we do 6 figures annually in total on CTV and it works great for us.
