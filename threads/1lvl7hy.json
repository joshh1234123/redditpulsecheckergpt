Real example, you target people that visit ESPN.com with as low CPM as possible to create a big pool of ESPN readers. You could then go sell that audience or just avoid paying for an audience of \"sports enthusiasts\". You may not think of it as nefarious, but audience data is highly valuable to pubs. Many of their agreements with DSPs prevent doing it.",
