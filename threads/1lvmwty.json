      "body": "  \nI completely get where you’re coming from. It’s very common in programmatic advertising. Most DSPs set minimums of $5K to $10K per month because they can’t profitably manage smaller budgets with full service. So you’re not doing anything wrong—that’s just how the industry operates. At **DurantaDev,** we make it easier for smaller brands and agencies to try programmatic and display advertising without a huge upfront spend. We group several brands under our managed account. That way, you still get access to quality inventory, effective targeting, and expert pacing, but you don’t have to worry about meeting those big minimums alone. If you’re doing local B2B efforts, like reaching out to business owners or executives in your city, we keep it simple and realistic. We use geo-targeting, some contextual layers, and retargeting to ensure your ads reach the right audience. No wasted spending, no complicated setup that’s hard to track. With a budget of around $1.5K to $3K a month over a few months, you’ll see what’s working and decide if it makes sense to scale up. Plus, you stay in control throughout the process. We pace the spend wisely, set clear daily caps, and provide transparent reports so you always know exactly where your money goes. If you’re interested, I’d be happy to share a quick example of how we’d set it up—including geo-targeting, audience, and expected reach. No pressure at all. Just let me know if you want to see it. Hope this helps! I love seeing brands test things out intelligently before going all in.   \n  \nCheers!",
