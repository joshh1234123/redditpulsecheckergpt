      "body": "No access yet, site isn’t complete. But leaning toward low upfront self service costs, Choolze or IQM both have super low minimums to start and have capabilities similar to that of a TTD or DV. Even a reseller would work. Thankfully the DSP seat would be the main cost to eat since a lot of other channels are free to run on, minus a few. \n\nAnd ya that’s the problem, clients and agencies need proper education not pricing promises. If performance is there, pricing can be adjusted. Especially if you are self serve which i know a lot of people are not.\n\nTLDR most don’t actually know what they are doing so they look to that pricing for reassurance. I’d say maybe 20% of marketing people actually know and have set up a proper programmatic campaign. The other 80% are just asking others to set it up.",

Once and if interest is seen I’ll probably look to a reseller to get a seat in DV360 since that’s my bread n butter at my Ft gig",

Then just doing the ole organic/paid promotion to get things circulating. \n\n\nAnything to watch out for?",
