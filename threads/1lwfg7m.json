Day…. \n\nBuuuuut because of this it makes its easier to get jobs, people keep getting fired/letgo :)\n\nLiterally was a assistant director 4 months and saw 4 different people get let go for your reasons. Asking the same questions every day, no initiative, no problem solving skills, really just pencil pushers tbh, they click in and out. Resumes looked great and they could talk but boy, did they just suck ass.",

If they then still would come back to me, or a colleague after I'd raise this in a 1-1 to understand why they don't retain the troubleshooting skills or actually take notes on how to solve for the challenge.",

      "body": "This is a well-documented issue across the industry. Having worked with multiple NYC-based marketing agencies and dozens of professionals, it’s evident that programmatic advertising presents unique complexity challenges. There’s often a clear distinction between practitioners who are self-taught versus those who learned from experienced programmatic specialists. The most effective programmatic professionals typically build teams on the agency side before transitioning to consulting roles.\n\nKnowledge gaps emerge for several key reasons:\n\n1. Insufficient leadership development and knowledge transfer. When senior practitioners lack the time or capability to mentor analysts, institutional knowledge erodes. This creates a cycle where analysts advance to leadership positions without adequate foundational training, as recent graduates are left to self-educate.\n\n2. High industry turnover rates. The practice of changing agencies for 20% salary increases has historically been common, leading to talent migration before deep expertise can be fully developed. Top programmatic specialists often move to technology companies or consulting firms, further depleting agency knowledge bases.\n\n3. Limited practical learning opportunities. While theoretical training programs exist, programmatic expertise requires hands-on campaign building and optimization experience with substantial budgets. Managing campaigns at scale provides learning opportunities that smaller budget campaigns cannot replicate.\n\n4. Rapid technological evolution. The programmatic landscape changes continuously, with manual optimization techniques potentially becoming obsolete as platforms like DV360 deprecate certain features and demand-side platforms become increasingly automated, reducing the need for manual intervention.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nKnowledge gaps occur because incentives keep people moving firms and ultimately a lot of institutional knowledge gets lost.",

This person was an emergency hire and, for the past year, has slowly dragged me down. I’ve provided docs on basics, I’ve done one-on-one trainings, I’ve recorded step-by-steps, and this person still doesn’t get it. They might as well have hired no one because the imbalance of work is insane. The only good thing about this situation is that this person doesn’t mind doing mind-numbing grunt work, and I use that as often as possible. But even at times, that’s too much for them. Common sense and critical thinking are no longer necessary for employment.",
