      "body": "Silly question here, but isn’t this going to be impossible to compare due to differences in identity graphs and how each DSP measures their conversions? \n\nBasis and TTD aren’t going to use the same graphs and there could be nuances like cookie / cookieless attribution, UID (TTD) vs no UID (Basis) so there’s naturally going to be discrepancies.",

      "body": "As I think others are alluding to, I think this is more an issue of how you’re setting up the test. Targeting similar audiences & inventory on two DSPs, there will certainly be overlap- I’m not sure how you (or DSP measurement) could truly differentiate or accurately attribute conversions. Turning off view-through measurement then basically will just be last-touch attribution, which we all know is highly flawed. I don’t think the conversion count in Basis is shady- I’d assume it’s just that users exposed to ads served via Basis ended up clicking on a TTD ad prior to conversion. \nI think the only way you do this is to run a 30-day test on each while the other DSP is dark? That way you can also manage frequency caps, etc- right now you aren’t - and could be bidding against yourself, just doesn’t sound like an effective test.",
