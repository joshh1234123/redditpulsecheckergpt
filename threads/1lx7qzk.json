But have a certain campaign where need to run using DV.",

      "body": "I was going to suggest looking into shopping: it’s a superior product to the DCO/DV360 setup and Google ads tends to be more affordable and higher up in the ad stack (second reason: clients trust clicks, not view through where majority of CM360 / DV360 traction appears). I have a great group that can do custom builds in DCO if you need (really more of a creative discipline than a media one), but with Google Shopping and Criteo on the market (which, btw also wins cheaper inventory because it makes upfront deals with Google), it’s hard to argue that DCO via CM/DV will ever compete. \n\nGoogles agency ad tech is just second rate. I wish they’d invest or spin it off and let it die (bc let’s be real: if it weren’t Google backed, CM would NOT exist).  Good luck and glad to DM.",
