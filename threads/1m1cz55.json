      "body": "Mostly what's unique about it is the accessible inventory. You can buy IMDb, MGM, Twitch, Alexa, Prime Video, etc (Amazon O&O inventory) natively in-platform. Can't do that on TTD as far as I know, unless you go direct.\n\nYou can also leverage Amazon Attribution to track click-throughs to Amazon storefronts, Detailed Page Views, Add-to-Carts, Purchases, and Revenue. You can use Amazon Attribution in other DSPs, but that functionality is currently in beta. I use it for a client who activates in TTD and drives to an Amazon landing page; it works fine.\n\nAmazon DSP is fine for beginners, it's just slow as hell and clunky. I don't enjoy using the platform.\n\nI leaned on DV360 (back then it was DBM) and then I've learned TTD three times lol (legacy, Solimar, and now Kokai).",

      "body": "For sure it's getting better and more powerful to take on DV / TTD but is still no.3 in my opinion.\nIf your an endemic brand, it's tailor made to work and once you add AMC to the mix, very powerful. This is what Google / ADH was supposed to be but isn't.\nBut it has flaws, whether it's the UI (though the update this year made it much better vs past), reporting, ad quality and tracking (AAT is pretty poor in comparison to other pixel solutions and Conversion API also lacks certain things).",
