      "body": "If you run PMP deals and the floor price is anything above ~$0.10(I don’t know the actual number), predictive clearing will try bid below this to clear at lower bids, however, it won’t scale your campaigns as the publisher/partner has set their clearing price at a minimum. \n\nIf you’re using KoKai, from my experience, I’ve seen the platform have their average bid price towards the max bid, so I’d recommend reducing this as soon as the campaign starts scaling so you’re not over paying for inventory (with predictive clearing off), you’ll see high win rates which indicates KoKai is pushing bids to the max bid price \n\nPredictive clearing is good if used well, like the comment above, if running on OE, always have on. If you’re seeing floor prices, turn off for scale (but limit max bids) & if you can, have it on and reduce max bids too, to reduce the fees",

You wont scale.\n\nAlso, if you're using Kokai, TTD adds their own \"Sellers & Publishers 500\" curated deal *by default.* So you have to go into Inventory Controls and turn that off every time you make a new ad group. If you're running a PMP deal, that's not good. I can't tell you how many times that's bitten me in the ass. I submitted a bug report and asked them to remove that feature.",

Predictive clearing will hurt scale against these types of deals because this feature only pays attention to the LABELED floor on the private contract page, and not the actual floors sent in request data. If you want to avoid turning off predictive clearing, just leave the labeled floor of the deal blank. It’s optional. Don’t enter 0 as this is considered a value, just blank.",
