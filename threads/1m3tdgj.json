      "body": "Have you looked into a media buyer role at an agency? I went from a digital marketing strategist role (that ONLY touched digital) to a media buyer/planner at an agency. I had almost no programmatic/DSP experience but I did know some high-level stuff and how to set up ads in other platforms like Hulu Ad Manager or MNTN, so that helped me step into the role. It sounds like you have extensive digital experience, which is what I had too, and I think if an agency sees that experience, they'd be more than willing to take you on as a media buyer and teach programmatic. That's what happened for me, and I found the trade desk platform pretty easy to learn, they have good courses too. I would start by looking at an agency and then an AdTech company.",

      "body": "Easiest way would be to see if you can start this work at your current agency. Express your interest during development conversations. Even if it starts small, that's experience you can begin to leverage around what already sounds to be a well rounded digital background. Take the trade desk and dv360 courses for self education if helpful / not yet complete. From there maybe your current company can work with you or you can pursue a new opportunity leveraging a mix of hands on and transferable knowledge.",

If you can use  paid ads, jumping over to a DSP isn't going to be too difficult for you (I train people to use DSPs). The trade desk has a free cert I believe, check and see if DV360 does also. And keep applying ☺️☺️",
