The biggest changes with Vengo since then is that because they sell more than just their own screens and they have exclusive programmatic partnerships with other media owners, they’ve grown to over 61,000 screens and continue to expand. So we have this pretty large scale and our own proprietary Ad Server. \n\nIf you want any additional details or a media kit please let me know. I don’t want to be too sales-pitchy here, but I’d love to help however I can. \n\nThe reddit community has been pretty helpful with answering my questions regarding wood, games, and even LASIK— so just trying to return the favor.",
