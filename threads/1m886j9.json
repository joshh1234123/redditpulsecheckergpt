      "body": "Not all pre-bid is made equal and you could argue certain components are doing more harm than good. \nYou'd also have to break out brand suitability/safety vs fraud when you think of both of these areas.\nPersonally there are processes / approaches to setup that can make pre-bid less relevant and post-bid will never be perfect if there is dependency on JS to track. But verification is ultimately important to most advertisers, you just need to be keeping an eye on the measurable impressions on the post-bid side out of your total.",
