It’s maybe not for everyone, but if you drink the koolaide and are helpful to others, it’s a fantastic place to be. Amazon forces managers to cut the bottom of their team every year, even if your whole team is performing above goal. \n\nIn terms of Billionaire CEO’s, Jeff is probably as good as it gets (in this class). There is no such thing as a good billionaire, but sometimes he tries to be a good person.",

      "body": "Amazon has a better long term outlook based on their resources and assets. TTD can be a great place to work, but can also be a nightmare depending on the team you’re on and on commercial teams, the accounts you’re assigned. There is a cultish cliqueyness, especially with employees that have been there a long time. Managers will acknowledge this toxicity but at the end of the day boot you out if you fail to conform, regardless of performance. Amazon is a big machine, but it is possible to transfer out of advertising.",

If you choose the path of programmatic TTD gives you that focus and freedom where basically everyone at the company knows what we are doing. Culture wise TTD is at that sweet spot of a few thousand employees and not hundreds of thousands like Amazon. TTD will give you more flexibility to innovate, less red tape, growth opps etc...",

With Amazon Advertising having much higher operating margins and lower profitability compared to AWS or the retail business guess where Amazon will cut staff first? That's right Amazon advertising",

      "body": "Product offering:\nIMO Amazon has a better long-term value prop vs. TTD. Amazon has the technology/resources to build their offering to parity with TTD, but they also own their own O&O inventory and have the best deterministic 1p dataset available anywhere. Anyone that claims Amazon DSP is not an objective likely has never managed a campaign in that platform. You can run any 3P deal ID in ADSP that you can run in TTD and they are rolling out a new suite of solutions to manage 3p publisher commitments in the UI seamlessly. \nTTD has a better offering today than Amazon, but that’s only because Amazon is still playing catch-up product-wise. TTD owns nothing and while they claim to objectivity, just ask anyone who works there about what OpenPath is and they will start stuttering. TTD is getting squeezed and will be likely laying people off in the next 6 months (recruiting efforts have been frozen on some teams recently)\n\nEmployee experience:\nLike most places so much of it depends on what team you are on/who you work for. From what I’ve heard Amazon Ads is very much a part of the overall Amazon corporate work culture (intense atmosphere, aggressive growth targets/goals, stack ranking employees etc.), but if you can stomach that and you are a high performer it can be a very rewarding experience. Both companies  pay well. With TTD there are now enough question-marks on TTDs value in an Agentic AI advertising world to make you wonder long-term how sustainable their dominance is. TTD prob does have a better work/life balanance though",

The DSP sucks, lots of weird rules designed to protect Amazon’s core retail business and a weird creative approval process that often delays basic campaigns. Our Amazon support contacts are less than helpful and seems like they’ve drunk the koolaid and don’t have any answers. I would never go work there. The only good thing ADSP has going for it is the data they have to target campaigns. Even the Prime inventory isn’t great due to scaling issues.",

Jeff Green IS a good CEO. Good at the job and seems to be a good employer (Kookai seems to rob from advertisers, but someone’s got to make the stock go boom). Bezos - famous for the “up or out” employer culture of Amazon - has been out for the entirety of Amazon’s media ascendency and it’s fair to say isn’t setting the tone for someone contemplating a role in programmatic at Amazon in 2025. \nLove that it’s “dumb” to associate one of the most famous CEOs in history (also one of the most famous Jeff’s) with the trait he’s known for (billionaire status). Should have just as likely assumed you were referring to Epstein @ninja-squirrel…",
