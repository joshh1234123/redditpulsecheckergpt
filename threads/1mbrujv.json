Are we talking 1,000 or 100,000?\n\nYou can find partners regardless of scale, but I would question data fidelity for the smaller players as they have less ingestion points for attributes.\n\nI work at Epsilon, who I would say leads the category for offerings. Feel free to DM if you have questions.",
