Is this for a job?\n\nThese are all things that scare me for your client and company since they are basics. I keep wondering how people get into these positions of pickings dsps and have not done cursory research, but whatevs. I’m not gate keeping or hating.\n\nI’d do DV if anything or stick to Google display network. Do not settle on a DSP as a managed service unless you really don’t care and are just looking to get things running. Such a waste of fees. But You are looking for anything additive that goes above and beyond, any DSP can do video, but what is special? Lift Studies? Bidding types? ATT? Reporting? Do research, take some calls. \n\nMNTN is pretty much only video with limited targeting and reporting. Works if you just need to get stuff live. Terrible if you are actually trying to build and manage a full programmatic stack/plan. DV/TTD are tier one, they have literally anything you could want in DSP. Audio, display, video, CTV. Comes with a higher learning curve, but a proper trader can do it all for a low cost and competitive CPM.",
