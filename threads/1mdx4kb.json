I also vaguely remember TTD putting filters in place that don’t allow targeting at sensitive places. I can’t remember if it’s global or just the US, that’s my bad for not remembering that. \n\nFoursquare, HERE, Veraset, GroundTruth are a couple others to look at. \n\nSomething else to think about, they may not allow you to directly target hospitals because of privacy reasons. So they won’t have an off the shelf segment. You may need to make your own segment of Lat/long coordinates that encompasses all the hospitals and not tell them what you’re actually targeting. Which is a lil slimy, but that may be how your competitor is doing it.",
