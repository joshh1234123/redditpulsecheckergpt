      "body": "Hi all,\nBy optimisation, I mean can we create some triggers using any open source data. For example - real time weather related data for the location where DOOH screen is placed can be used to understand the footfall volume at any moment. If it’s raining heavily then obviously we’ll encounter low footfall there and we can reduce delivery there. This was just a vague example which can help us reach more people. I’m looking for something similar.",

Tbh would be a great collaborative effort for this subreddit to compile a list of all the open source data out there because there’s no reason to pay 3rd parties for at least 30-40% of the segments (would argue more given how much data is BS) they offer when open source data is available.",
