      "body": "Not sure why Meta is getting attribution (pun intended) for the concept of a conversions API. The reality is that more and more event tracking is moving server-side and the recent Shopify change will likely hasten this shift. Although the IAB is in the pocket of big tech (moreso Google than Meta) creating an industry standard here would simplify things for a developer’s perspective. Conforming to a bunch of different API endpoints tends to involve more resources than placing a pixel on a website so a single standard would really help simplify adoption and keep programmatic from losing share to Meta.",
