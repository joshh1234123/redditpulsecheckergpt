Then try and understand the areas where jobs exist in the market (and therefore skills are at a shortage), including understanding salaries.\n\nMatch your skills, and passion, with market demand.

Maximise your learning, be curious and keen, and go above and beyond.\n\nCurrently, the tech side is probably still the best route to maximise your earnings, but there are rarely junior roles available.",

      "body": "I'd personally recommend staying in the agency game a bit longer. It might not be the best for earnings, but obtaining hands on keys experience and then more hollistic/strategic experience within an agency is a killer combo. I think that will set you up for greater success in future ad-tech/client side roles where pay will be better",

They will likely pay more than client side.\n\nI agree with the other comment to learn what problems you enjoy solving while you’re young in your career. Some jobs will pay well but make you miserable, and while young it may make sense to think of the money, it pays better to be great at something you actually enjoy spending time doing.",
