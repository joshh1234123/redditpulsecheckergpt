      "body": "Smart move, though now you will directly be competing with the DoubleVerify / Zefr / Channel Factory / Pixability of this world.\n\nYou may also want to think about automating the application of the channel list into Google Ads / DV360, it is the worst part of the process and unfortunately can be problematic with larger lists when using bulksheets vs API. Some of those competitors have attempted to build solutions in that space also for reference.\n\nI'd also proposition both type of lists, as inclusion lists are not supported on every YT enabled campaign type i.e. a PMAX or Demand Gen.",

SDF exports from DV360 are super messy with YouTube channel lists as the SDF format makes it to so it exceeds character limits per cell.

My tool is self-serve and currently takes 5 mins to audit all your channel delivery and 5 mins to create new bespoke channel lists. \n\nThanks I will definitely look into that more! I've used the API a bit but ideally need an advertiser to work with to test it.\n\nAnd also good point! I still have the exclusion lists ready to use so will make them available for users to download too.\n\nGreat feedback by the way, really appreciate the comments!",

But depending on the advertiser / agency, the cost of this \"tool\" may be needing to be factored in any KPI calculation or come out of the working media, so then having it in the platform becomes mandatory. Though CPM Fees will always remain not possible to add manually into DV360 Line Items so that then becomes a separate manual process.\n\nBut this is a good idea as long as you provide transparency / have the ability to refresh the lists often, I have experimented a little myself in this area.",
