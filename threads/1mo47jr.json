      "body": "It’s difficult to build the infra from 0. Deals, custom audiences, reporting, You have experience with media buying but the thing with programmatic is that it’s a bit closed world. There are dsp’s that do not require you to spend a fortune every month but…usually they get their money otherwise. And it limits the service you can offer heavily.  \nIf programmatic is small part of your revenue stream then get a good partner who has access to ttd and/or google and start your buying with them until you understand what is happening. Choice of dsp depends on your clients, ad formats and some have very special inventory or targeting. For example ttd is very good for spotify and ctv deals. Amazon has their huge customer database, dv360 has youtube and google data, moloco is good for apps etc. But you can’t run gambling ads on dv360, ttd is quite expensive so it’s difficult to optimise towards low cpm but most dsp’s have some shortcomings. So pick your tools and partners wisely",
