      "body": "I think it’s important to remember that, regardless of what some companies say, CTV is still television and not a performance channel. It’s an awareness tactic that plays an important role in the journey, but unless you’re running creative that says, “99% off by visiting this page that’s only accessible from CTV exposure”, you’re going to get a lot of pixel duplication and partners claiming credit for the same conversion.",

      "body": "MMP pixel tracking is fine, just set a realistic attribution window for your product. If you can, drop your own impression pixel and run IP match attribution in-house for a cleaner truth table. Ask your CTV vendor for pure CTV only, no display or OTT. Run geo tests before going wide so you can see real incremental lift without muddy data from other channels.",

Some folks I know layer in a Tv specific platform like Tatari alongside their MMP so they can see lift across both linear + CTV in one place. It's less about replacing your stack and more about plugging the blind spots.",

      "body": "Sure, so in addition to direct pixel attribution, some platforms allow you to upload sale reports for additional \"offline\" attribution. That includes basic stuff like name, address, zip, email and most importantly a time stamp down to the minute. If you include revenue numbers it also allows for a direct ROI calculation. \n\nWe did it originally for offline sales with weak direct attribution for one of our brands (think high ticket, long sales cycle, difficult to attribute products or services) but now we also do it for a lot of our online stuff too for a fuller picture of attribution. The online stuff doesn't uncover a huge number of unknown or unattributed conversions until you look at first touch. \n\nThis also allows you to capture value out of more than last touch attribution but also, first touch, any touch, etc. \n\nWe have this going direct on a few brands, but it was actually our programmatic agency that turned us onto it and does it for us on maybe 60% of our campaigns. I know they do it for a lot of furniture, car sales, appliance sales companies-- systems that are notoriously difficult to capture direct attribution.\n\nedit: accidentally a word",
