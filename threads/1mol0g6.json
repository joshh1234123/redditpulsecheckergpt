      "body": "So high level, we have a Sales Team- responsible for prospecting and most pre-sale, then managing the relationship post-sale (check-ins, QBRs, entertaining, etc); a Customer Experience team with 3 divisions- sales engineers responsible for helping complete RFIs, deep demos, etc, Onboarding specialists, and Customer Success Managers (customer completes onboarding training and then gets assigned a CSM); and a Services team - experienced traders who can manage campaigns on behalf of clients. \n\nOur adops team (within services) typically doesn't engage on self-serve campaigns, only on managed. \n\nDoes that help?",

      "body": "We basically have an AE/AM combination that deals with 99% of every client's needs. AdOps in a pinch if workload is too cumbersome for activations. Managers offer vague \"support\" but it's mostly just administrative tasks and constant trainings that don't amount to much. New business comes from growth teams that drop clients onto your lap randomly and we're forced to onboard them.\n\nOverall small teams with little to no support. Gives you freedom but can lead to burnout during busier quarters.",
