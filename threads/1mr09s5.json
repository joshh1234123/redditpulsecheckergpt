I have worked on plenty that just tag Programmatic post-bid & use IAS pre-bid. And others who believe they should tag absolutely everything, with the main use case to take advantage of some of the unique \"quality\" metrics IAS can measure across all and then optimise towards it omnichannel.\n\nBut at the same time IAS & their competitors are pivoting their focus away from brand suitability and  more towards outcomes / context. So i'm sure you'll see more of their \"targeting\" solutions be pushed a lot going forwards across all channels.",
