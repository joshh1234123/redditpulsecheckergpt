      "body": "Congrats on getting diagnosed! That's a huge step and honestly the executive dysfunction in our field can be brutal without proper support.\n\n\n\nI actually went the opposite direction - was on Adderall for years but ended up quitting meds back in 2020 (still have the last prescription bottle sitting around lol). Not saying meds are bad at all, they just weren't sustainable for me long term.\n\n\n\nWhat I found was that programmatic work actually suits ADHD brains pretty well once you get systems in place. The data, the optimization, the constant pivoting - it's like our brains were made for it. But the executive function stuff... yeah that's the real killer.\n\n\n\nIf you're open to it, timeboxing saved my career. I plan every single day the night before and put everything on my calendar - not just meetings but actual work blocks. Sounds simple but it gives you that external structure your brain craves.\n\n\n\nAlso, duplicating everything helped me tons. Chargers in every room, backup headphones, etc. Removes so much friction when you're already fighting your brain to get started.\n\n\n\nThe meds will probably help a lot with focus, but don't sleep on building systems too. They work together really well and the systems stick around even if you ever decide to change your medication approach.\n\n\n\nHow are you finding the transition so far? The first few weeks can be pretty eye-opening.\n\n  \nDisclosure: I'm the founder of ScatterMind, where I help ADHDers become full-time entrepreneurs.",
