      "body": "**Hot take:** The big holdcos aren’t going extinct from AI, but they *have* to evolve.\n\nAI won’t replace agencies; it just makes marketing more complex, not less. Someone still needs to connect the dots: strategy, vendors, execution. The real threat isn’t AI, it’s whether these giants can adapt fast enough while independents and in-house teams move quicker. Evolve or fossilize. AI will kill lazy, pre-AI agency models that just resell commoditized services. The survivors will be the ones who adapt, turning into specialists, integrators, and translators between business problems and AI-driven execution.\n\nIf history with martech/adtech tells us anything, every “efficiency tool” actually created more work, not less. Same with AI: more tools → more complexity → more need for expertise.\n\nAgree or disagree?",
