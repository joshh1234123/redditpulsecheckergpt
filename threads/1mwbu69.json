      "body": "For your 1st question, your thought process is correct. The reseller will only charge you the media that’s run through your seat (inclusive of their fees) and the markup, the $110k from your example, is what you’d be invoicing your client.\n\nFor your 2nd question, the 15% fee the reseller charges you is generally baked into the media cost. So when you pull reporting for media cost, the 15% should already be baked in that. So in your example, if you put $100k as the budget for a campaign, $86,956 will go towards media and $13,044 will go to the reseller (X+0.15*X=$100K)\n\nAnybody please correct me if I’m wrong",
