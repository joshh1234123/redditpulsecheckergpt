If they split from TTD I expect them to lose a significant share of their non endemic advertisers from the platform when their audiences rarely offer any incremental reach against virtually any other audience from another retailer or premium data provider who isn’t built as a walled garden. \n\nCurrent Walmart DSP is just like TTD but shit and half the features. I don’t see advertisers who don’t sell shit in walmart (insurance, finance, etc.) needing to use their subpar product to achieve media results that can be achieved without using walmart.",
