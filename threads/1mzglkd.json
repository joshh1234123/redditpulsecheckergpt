Much better way of doing things.",

      "body": "Not a dumb question! I’ve found most clients have a hard time grasping programmatic and its use case, thinking it’s synonymous with high-intent products like Search. Spoiler: it is not. Anyone who is asking for such has no understanding of the ad type as these two ad products reach users in 2 completely different phases (programmatic during causal browsing while you’re focused on other content versus legit looking for a specific query) \n\nI think you mentioned you’re working in a silo, but I would recommend reviewing yourself or have them review their GA4/CRM. When running programmatic, you will almost always see an increase in leads/site visits/etc from direct, organic, referral, and even paid channels when prog ads are running. This is from brand recall - seeing the brand frequently enough that once the need arises, they’re more likely to conduct an online search (paid or organic) or type the website directly into the search bar. \n\nIf they’re insistent on leads, I would recommend having some form of conversion action set up in platform to be able to measure against as platform conversions will track view through, whereas GA4 is only click through. If you’re tracking a form fill, implement a conversion action for it; maybe even another action for form starts or a click to call numbers. \n\nGoodluck!",
