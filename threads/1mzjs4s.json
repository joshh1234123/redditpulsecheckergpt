      "body": "I think the main thing you need to ask yourself first is what branch of our industry do you want to shift into? Is it going to be client side, pub side or ad-tech? Some may require more strategic vision and experience catered to that, while others might require more of a commercial skill-set. Assuming you're currently working at an agency, I'd recommend developing your strategic and operational experience. Working out operational processes and strategic visions for the client(s) you're servicing to enhance those skill-sets",

Do you know how you would set out processes with an agency to ensure you can measure all you want? What about inentory/media planning approval processes? Creative approvals? \n\nThere's a lot of steps involved from a client wanting to invest media to an agency actually executing a campaign. Understanding how that process could work for both parties end-to-end and being able to set-out clear agreements on that topic is invaluable and crucial",
