Overworked and underpaid, I figured that it had to be like that in agencies and I immediately went vendor side. \n\nI call on agencies now in NY (hold co and a couple of indies) and I really try to make everyone’s lives easier. I really try to treat everyone I can (coffee, lunch, occasional gift card) just because I know how hectic things can get. \n\nAnyway. My base salary is 165 and I should be making double that ideally.",

With automated SDR companies crushing agency/client in-boxes its very difficult to connect with new prospects and even those agency folks one does have relationships with are not given much leeway to test new partners as agencies are increasingly more risk averse and budgets get gobbled up quickly by the walled gardens, RMNs and TTD.

I was making 120+ cold calls daily without the benefit of an account list and designated ad agencies to work with. I'm hesitating going back into sales because of my horrific last sales job. I am not a salesy sales person. Don't like cold calling, overcoming objections and the never-ending sea of rejections.

But this is under perfect conditions. A lot of this is right place, right time, luck, and also attainable goals. \n\nGoals are structured differently in different orgs. For example: at my previous 2 companies we had cliffs. And caps. \n\nCliff means that I have to reach a certain number of quota before commission kicks in. At my last org it was 70%. So if I’m at 69% to goal for a given quarter, I’m not getting paid commission. It SUCKS. 70% is also very high (this place sucked lol)\n\nCaps: commission is capped at a certain point. It was 200% to goal. So if my goal is (for example) is 1M a quarter and I bring in 2M, I’ve doubled my commission. If I bring in 3M, because of the cap, I’ve also doubled my commission. And so on. \n\nAt my current role, I am making money from dollar 1. No cliffs, no caps.  know it’s not gonna last too long (once sellers start bringing in big money, leadership have to reset goals/comp structure to reign everyone in. \n\nGoals are based on a variety of factors. Typically based on territory, historical data, average deal size, seller seniority, and at my last company they were pulled directly out of CRO’s ass. I left after a year.",
