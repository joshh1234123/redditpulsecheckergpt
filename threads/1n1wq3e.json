      "body": "Totally get where you’re coming from. A lot of U.S. clients keep deal creation and audience strategy in-house, but you can still build those skills on your own. Most SSPs/DSPs (like DV360, The Trade Desk) have free training resources that cover deal types, PMP setups, and audience creation. Pair that with case studies and sandbox accounts if you can get access, it’ll give you hands-on practice and help you stand out when those bigger responsibilities come your way.",
