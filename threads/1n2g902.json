      "body": "As the buyer, you don't use Google Ad Manager to create a VAST tag. You'd use something like Google Campaign Manager 360, which is essentially just an ad  server, to do that.\n\nYou'd want to upload your creative file to CM360 and then build out your campaign and placements based on the hierarchy in the platform (https://support.google.com/campaignmanager/answer/2826636?hl=en&ref\\_topic=2826623&sjid=16440780722825694022-NA). From there, you'd download and send the tags generated by CM360 to the publisher -- Google does the work for you in that regard.\n\nThis is a fairly complicated tool to jump into with no experience, so you should probably tell the publisher you don't have any experience with this and ask if they can host the creative for you or something like that.",

      "body": "You could technically hand-code a VAST tag, but it’s not really practical since most ad servers handle the XML generation for you. Without a server like GAM, you’ll be missing things like tracking, error handling, and creative delivery. Easiest route is to run it through an ad server (there are lightweight third-party ones if you don’t have GAM access) rather than trying to build the tag manually.",

I have some previous experience in the platform from working for an agency who had it, is this a necessity for the agency that I should ask higher ups to provide resources for us to purchase?\n\nThe vendor refused to host the creative or create the tag for us. Is this abnormal? I understand they have no obligation to do so, but it did seem strange as we’re obviously paying them for the placement. It’s a reputable vendor, but seemed odd to me at the time and now as you’ve said they’d possibly assist.",

If its DV360 for example, you could technically upload the raw video into the Creative Library as a new creative, then check the history log. Google basically converts it into a VAST tag (hosted through a CM360 account you won't have access to), which can then be passed onto the vendor.",

      "body": ">The vendor refused to host the creative or create the tag for us. Is this abnormal?\n\nIn my experience, this is abnormal, yes. I'm not saying it'll never happen, but usually if you're directly negotiating with a publisher, they're going to be more than willing to handle the creative hosting if you need it. I understand they have a cost that comes with ad serving (e.g., if you hosted the creative yourself in CM360, you'd pay a CPM fee somewhere around $0.25-$0.40 depending on your contract), but they should just be able to bake the cost of hosting your creative into your media buy.\n\nIf this is a quick-turn need, can you ask them if they could adjust the CPM to cover hosting the ad creative on your behalf? You'll get fewer impressions in total than what you agreed to up front, but that'll get the job done in a pinch. I can't imagine any publisher wouldn't be willing to work with you.",
