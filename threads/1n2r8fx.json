We'd match them to IPs of those visiting our site. Seemed to be the best and only way to attribute direct-response performance to CTV, but would love to hear if there are alternatives. We avoided Google and DV360 since their cross-device attribution was terrible and they didn't provide log-level data with IPs for us to look at. We also used UID2, but adoption of that was super low at the time - I think it's still low but growing.",

Which is a more narrow minded approach to media.\n\nAs for MMM, I know we use MMM and it hasn’t helped with proving CTV. But that could just be our client…. iykyk. So it could just be us. Lol",
