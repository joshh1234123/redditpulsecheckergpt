      "body": "I'm not sure if this is the issue you're running into, but if you go to the \"Amazon DSP Settings\" in the platform (Go to the Administration tab on the left and then click \"Go to Amazon DSP settings\"), you have to generate Seat IDs for your manager account with all of the SSPs when you first get started. It's a really annoying little quirk that I didn't know about ahead of time, but once you generate all the seat IDs, you should be good to go.\n\nI can't replicate this on my end because I already took this step, but if I recall, it was like 1 or 2 clicks and the seat IDs were generated for pretty much every major SSP out there.\n\nI'll be curious if this does the trick, so keep me posted.",

      "body": "Okay if you see bids on A DSP means setup from your end is fine. \n\nCase 1 - Incorrect seatid shared by client, due to which bids are visible but the bidder is unable to send a response due to incorrect seat and 100% bids are getting rejected. \n\nCase 2 - try to see if targeting is aligned on both the ends. Audience, geo, creative sizes, etc. Sometimes targeting mismatch leads to 100% rejection. \n\nCase 3 - Check if they’ve added correct deal id in the targeting. \n\nAlso not sure if you know this, Freewheel auto-pauses deals that do not receive bids for a certain number of days to help de-clutter their eco system. So check that as well",

Every agency we speak to advises ADSP is only available to buy Prime inventory and open web display, video.",
