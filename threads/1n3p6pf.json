      "body": "Fully self build can be arduous, fully out-sourced can be punitive on rev share costs and breadth of revenue e.g. if a revenue source wants to work with AppLovin', tha source has to guarantee them at least $50K in rev share income a month, which is putting off niche players that could probably achieve that, add lots of value, but don;t legally want to be tied to a contract tat might shaft them. I'd say the best approach is to use a managed service that gives you some autonomy and allows maximum competition. I went through this for a casual gaming business recently.",
