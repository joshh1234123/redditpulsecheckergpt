Currently working with a large player in the space for Curation efforts and working alongside the SSPs the agency has developed PADs and with our very own JBPs across DSPs and SSPs, it has allowed for a reduction in overall spend yet an increase in performance and reinvestment for the client.",

      "body": "I see this as more successful for agency holding group, where they have scale and connections to curate deals to push to agencies/advertisers.\n\n\nCynical side, also creates an opportunity to hide/make margin, and a new product to in house  programmatic advertisers.\n\n\nMy opinion, big players can build curated deals which make sense. Small players might find benefits moving to SSP and cutting out the DSP.\n\n\nThere is also in theory benefits moving closer to the SSP, reducing impacts of 'bid shaving' and ways the DSPs are trying to handle all the bid requests (and often duplicate requests due to header bidding plugged into multiple SSPs) but I've not really seen how this plays out.\n\n\nI'm not currently a hand on keyboard so all a pinch of salt my opinions are just from my general industry knowledge and not actually hands on with these setups.",
