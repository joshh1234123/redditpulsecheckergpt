There will always be a discrepancy because of that.\nUltimately the postback has to include a device id for Google to use properly on a Floodlight, which nowadays is not going to be a lot, especially on iOS. You also have different attribution methodology between GMP and Appsflyer.",

      "body": "First are you comparing Apples to Oranges? Which exact reports / views / metrics are you comparing between Appsflyer / CM360?\n\nIf it is anything to do with attribution, then Appsflyer will dedupe based on anything it sees (any linked partners) + organic + SSoT (if enabled). CM360 will dedupe between any advertiser / campaign tied to the floodlight configuration, which is likely different to what Appsflyer sees. Given you are sending all events as the postback, CM360 will then try dedupe in its own world based on device\\_id existing & last touch.",

      "body": "The metrics and dimensions are correct (floodlight activities are mapped correctly on Appsflyer), and so the reports are correct.\n\nThat is why I think it is attribution (either model or window), although both MMP and DSP are last touch.\n\nBut from your comment, I think I could try and remove sending all events.",
