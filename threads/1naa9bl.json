It’s just not worth the effort, technical resources, and capacity costs. Try to reach out to bidswitch to integrate and if you generate enough spend then you can reach out to ssps",

      "body": "Yes, right now it would be $40 per month at 20%, but who knows what will happen in 1–2 years?\n\nAbout \"the setup costs, server costs, bandwidth, manpower, campaign validation\" - I don’t know your situation, how big your team is, or maybe you are using a white-label DSP + white-label Prebid and the team is not actually yours. I think some white-label Prebid or white-label SSP providers offer a convenient GUI for integrating third-party DSPs, or charge 0% commission for connecting new DSPs. Or maybe you already have full-time developers that need to be kept busy since they are paid anyway. In my understanding, 20–30 req/sec would not create a noticeable server load. Also, integration usually does not take much time if the protocol is compatible and there is Prebid compatibility. (In my sandbox I already run my own Prebid server, with a DSP connected on one side and a test site on the other)\n\nRegarding the $10–20K per month ad spend - I know ad networks for whom $1-3K per month is enough to get connected. But at the current stage I don’t need such a big spend. First, I want to stabilize the system and collect the first successful cases myself before charging anyone for it. So right now this is more like an internal tool for affiliate marketing, and I’m not in a rush. I don’t need to maintain a team of people, just my own time and around $100 for production servers. In the meantime, I will also be slowly customizing my own Prebid server, creating and connecting mobile apps. Maintaining apps is cheaper than maintaining websites, since they don’t require hosting.",
