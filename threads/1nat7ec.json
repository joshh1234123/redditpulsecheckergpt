      "body": "I flight evenly all the time in DV360 and never had this problem. Could be dependent on whether your pacing settings are set to asap at the line item or IO level. Maybe your bids are too high causing the win rate to be too high. But if you have a daily spend cap, it should not be having that problem. I’ve even paced asap but with the spend cap, it never encountered that problem. I would flag this to DV360 and maybe even ask for a make good because it seems apparent that their system isn’t following the rules",

      "body": "Sounds like pacing didn’t quite kick in the way you expected. Even with daily even spend + fixed CPM, delivery can fluctuate depending on available inventory and competition at that time of day. Yesterday may have had lighter demand, so budget stretched longer.\n\nYou might try setting stricter pacing controls (if your platform allows), narrowing inventory, or adding hourly caps to smooth it out. Otherwise the system may front-load spend when there’s a surge of impressions available in your target window.",
