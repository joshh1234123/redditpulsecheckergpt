However, I do know that in markets like Singapore, Malaysia etc. TTD has more of a managed service model and are just viewed as another vendor rather than a self-serve DSP so perhaps a similar situation will occur in India",

India is very low on the list of GDP per capita, - I.e. the “return” part of ROAS is harder to achieve. With an abundance of supply in India with relatively lower opportunity of return, I imagine it makes demand very sensitive to anything that increases ad spend like high fees",
