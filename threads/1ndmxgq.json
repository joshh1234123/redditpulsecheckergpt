      "body": "I used to also think that you’d should tie a campaign to a performance goal like sales, cpa, etc but the truth of the matter is that the vast majority of people don’t actually interact with ads and programmatic is really good at targeting a bunch of people that may or may not have been exposed to your brand before.  Theres also a boatload of advertisers where their website sales mean nothing compared to in-store sales at retailers.\n\nIt is kinda crazy that CTR is the key benchmark but that’s how agencies sell it. Non marketing executives also understand a click metric. But in reality, it’s hard to quantify programmatic display from a performance standpoint compared to search and social. Viewthrough conversions aren’t tracked in analytics platforms like GA4 or Shopify so relying on just DSP conversion data as the source of truth really doesn’t mean much because it takes credit for all conversions that a display ad touch without any consideration for other channel touch points. Back in the day like 5ish years ago it was a lot easier to track path to conversion across channels so you could see how programmatic played a role in the conversion path but with cookieless/walled gardens/iphone privacy in the past few years this has made it more difficult to do. \n\nUltimately people need to know about your brand before considering so focusing on just performance with programmatic will limit your overall reach. It’s more important to reach the target audience at a decent frequency so that they actually have brand recall.",

There are smarter clients out there that are using Mutitouch attribution, Media Mix Modelling, incrementality studies. Brand lift studies are kinda bs too but still better than CTR. Problem won’t get better with existing client. Needs a ton of education and change of mindset from leaders at the top. Also I worked for a large agency and their priority is to spend in full always and a lot are yes people and just go with the status quo. Varies by team and client though.

      "body": "I think this is a normal experience shifting from performance minded \"smaller\" advertisers to large enterprise clients. For the smaller businesses, every marketing dollar is scrutinized and investigated to help the business grow. When working in programmatic for large multinational corporations, programmatic and digital marketing budgets are just a small responsibility of a marketing director's job. In the end, they want to retain their budgets every year which is why they emphasize spending in full so procurement/finance let's them keep the same budgets. As to why not everything is tied to outcomes, it's partially because they have dedicated performance budgets or because a large part of their view on marketing is that it's about awareness and brand building.\n\nNeither of the two approaches is necessarily wrong, but the way you execute and understanding how people perceive your brand should be key. All you need to do to see a real life example of this is Nike's failed shift from brand focused advertising to a full performance brand, which they're now heavily back pedalling on. They've probably figured out that in the end performance marketing isn't the main driver of their growth and focusing too much of their marketing spend in that direction has averse affects on their brand image.",

The idea is to tangibly demonstrate open web media’s impact on intent-driven Search outcomes - the question is what would that look like?",

Bad guys have had a 15 year run selling larger and larger quantities of ad impressions and clicks and the largest of advertisers (that spend the most money) are the ones who are most happy with \"raising awareness.\" When pressed about performance, they reply with click through rates. When pressed further, they cite \"brand lift studies\" (which can also be easily gamed). When asked about ad fraud, they cite legacy fraud detection companies that can't detect more than 1% \"invalid traffic.\" And so they continue.

Absolutely\n\nBut should you rely on attribution as a means for determining success of a channel where a click means very little? Absolutely not\n\nThere is so much more optimisation possibilities in programmatic vs any other channel.
