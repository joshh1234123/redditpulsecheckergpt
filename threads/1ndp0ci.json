I am not talking about a standard PCA / Weekly report but something like combining different variables or full blown log level data. That is the power of programmatic that you don't get in any other paid ads medium.\n\nPersonally this is a hobby of mine now vs a job, to the point I am creating my own educational content (most of which will be free) to help whoever needs it.",
