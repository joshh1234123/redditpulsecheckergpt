      "body": "27k sessions in 30 days is definitely enough to start monetizing with display — you don’t need to wait. Mediavine Journey has stricter requirements, but there are plenty of other networks and exchanges that work well for sites your size.\n\nA few options worth looking at:  \n**Ezoic** \\- lower entry barrier, good testing tools.  \n**Newor Media** \\- we work with publishers starting at \\~30k sessions/month, and focus on optimizing yield with header bidding + premium demand sources.  \n**SheMedia** \\- solid if your audience skews lifestyle/female-focused.  \n**Monumetric** \\- requires a setup fee under certain traffic levels, but can be a fit for tool/content sites.\n\n27k sessions is a solid base, you’ll see better results than running AdSense alone. If you keep growing toward 50k–100k, more premium networks will open up, but there’s no reason to leave money on the table right now.",
