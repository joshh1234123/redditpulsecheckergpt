      "body": "Depending on the DSP there will be different levels to assign budget caps, reduce risk one errant line item won't blow out too badly if the capped at the IO. \n\n\nI would expect for all DSPs there will be a 'credit limit' to the overarching account that would also create a cap for a complete blow out (they aren't going let you wrack up $10mil debt if the know the company could never afford that, especially with the trickle down they have to pay other vendors)\n\n\nOtherwise it's all just risk mitigation, QA campaigns, monitoring campaigns to catch issues early. \n\n\nUltimately it's the company responsibility to have process and good staff to not fuck up. But mistakes happen. \n\n\nI've seen companies I've work at have to eat the cost of a mistake, in some cases I've been genuinely surprised the person kept their job. \n\n\nOtherwise I would suggest asking your legal team and/or whoever knows the specific of your DSPs contracts if you want to understand more. \n\n\nI suspect there could also be some sort of insurance the company could tap into if an employee really fucked up - I'd like to think one wrong button couldn't bankrupt a company but also that wouldn't surprise me.\n\nEdit to Add, my current role I'm not hands on normal campaigns but I do testing in Xandr and I do like they have a backup account level daily cap.

      "body": "As others have said, QA- and have processes in place - no one person should build and launch without another set of eyes on it to help double check. In our DSP we have user level permissions where a junior person can build a campaign, but we can require a manager to review it to approve launch - granular user-level controls are key. And yes of course there is a credit limit and alerts so even if a worst-case-scenario-thing happened, it isn't like someone could screw up and spend $1 million in a day without multiple alarms going off.",

We also do not give everybody full access to the bank account and with DSP is seems like normal things I would expect like credit limit or max spend I can put on per user are things I barely see. I am confused that this is a risk is not tackled by DSP as a standard setting",
