What you do not want is for them to find out and alert everyone before hand, that wouldn’t look good at all. I’d also go through the data and pull any wins if possible, just go the extra mile and think of positives and work around if you can. \n\nSilver lining - At least you caught it, at least it didn’t spend everything. \n\nEveryone makes mistakes in this industry, it’s very easy with the amount of levers and fill ins. But owning up to it and saying you’ve learned a lesson, is not something everyone will do. Literally just apologize and make sure it doesn’t happen again is what is key.",
