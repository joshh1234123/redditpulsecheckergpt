Typically it was 15-20% YoY. What will likely see is reps leaving because there is no way they are making those targets. As for strategists it’s even worse. They are taking their yearly base salary and actually slice and dicing it into different categories effectively cutting your monthly salary by 35-40% and essentially dangling that revenue to either end year or mid year when you’ll get it.",

What confuses me is whether IPG really needs so much additional headcount, since the quality of work isn’t very high as some of my friends say they just sit idle doing basic tasks while most of the real work is handled by the onshore teams. A few people have even advised me not to consider IPG for at least the next year because of recent structural changes that have made many employees want to leave.",
