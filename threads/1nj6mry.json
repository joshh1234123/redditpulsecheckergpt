      "body": "What you need is a DSP that can send all bid requests to your own bidder in real time. [Beeswax](https://www.beeswax.com) (FreeWheel) is one option for this.   \nSome white-label stacks like [Epom](https://epom.com/dsp) can also do it, but you should check if they really forward requests live and not just give you log files.Prepayment is normal — most will ask for a deposit and limit how many requests you get per second. If you want full control, you can also plug straight into supply through BidSwitch, but that takes more contracts and heavier ops.",
