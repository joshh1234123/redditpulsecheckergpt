However, after the excitement died out, I took a careful look at it and alarm bells went off. I then checked the careers page and saw that my status for the role I applied was updated to “not moving forward” which kind of confirmed to me that this was potentially a scam. I’m still not sure though and hope I didn’t make a mistake by ignoring the email",
