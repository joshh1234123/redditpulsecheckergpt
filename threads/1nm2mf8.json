Basically, “what if I move X% of spend to CTV” or “what if inventory tightens over the holidays” without being locked into past data.\n\nMadhive’s Planner does some of this already (scenario comparisons, supply/audience modeling, etc.), and they’ve been expanding features pretty quickly. Might be worth a look if you want something beyond “last quarter = next quarter.”",
