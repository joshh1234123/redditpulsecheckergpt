      "body": "They're better quality-wise primarily because you can be sure the inventory you're buying is actually associated with the publishers you're trying to buy from. Plus, you can work with your reps to craft something that's more contextually relevant (e.g., if you wanted to exclude news from your inventory, they should be able to do so). It's really tough to say for sure how good/bad the inventory packages are in terms of quality content, but you could always run through both and see which one works better for your or gives you more exposure to the pubs you want and decide from there.",

      "body": "If you're mainly concerned about quality, direct deals usually provide more predictable audiences and less risk of remnant inventory. Matketplace floors can be cheaper, but targeting and reach can be inconsistent. You could try checking on Tatari since they run campaigns across premium CTV like Hulu, ESPN and Disney+ and provide reporting that shows how different inventory sources actually perform.",

      "body": "I’d say if you do others that include a “mix” of other stuff with something premium like Hulu, in my experience it’s mostly going to be some FAST CTV with some Hulu inventory. $25.50 floor is pretty fair we usually get rates a little lower because the agency negotiated rates with Hulu directly for our agency to come in lower. Is the $35 ESPN for CTV or OLV?",
