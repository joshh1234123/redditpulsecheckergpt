Really though, I would not pay the same. The CPM would have to be less and I’d consider things like time of day as a big factor for targeting. 9-5 Monday to Friday would be a lower bid for me. Maybe it’s something on in the background at work for example. Maybe someone traveling for work, etc. I’d test it a portion of the budget to see if it’s working if the client wants to. \n\nBut as a consumer in either instance I would be less likely to do anything from a mobile/desktop while streaming that content because I’d be on the go or occupied and have it on in the background. \n\nThat being said, I still target devices on this line item, pull reporting to make sure and use a measurement partner to confirm the devices reached are CTV/Set top box.",
