If you already have a strong mix of streaming platforms and OS types reached in your existing deals I wouldn’t go out of your way to run on this inventory source unless you had extra budget you need / want to spend at scale.",

      "body": "I'm not sure about Xumo in particular, but in general, CTV OS vendors do have unique placements/ad formats. These are placements on the GUI that can be display or video, often with click-through capabilities. This can be unique, valuable inventory. Think full screen video or display \"masthead\" or \"hero\" opportunity on the TV as it is turned on, as the viewer navigates to find content, and returns to the CTV home page.",

      "body": "Great  for reach and to bring down your effective CPM. \n\nTo be honest - they’re  trying to slice  it so many ways to try and consider it unique. \n\nThink of CTV similar how TV is bought. They’ve always bought based upon the content first. Then audience. Then salespersons attractiveness score. \n\nIn tv if you didn’t meet your audience demands, you get free spots (ADU’s) to fulfill the buy. In digital you only pay for what’s run.",
