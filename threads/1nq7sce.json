Media buying is becoming far more automated and manual optimizations will be, if they aren’t already, completely automated in time. If your whole skillset is trafficking ads, bid factoring and trimming inventory, unfortunately you’re going to be made redundant by AI.",

A Google / Amazon don't really need sales reps nowadays.\nSSP - this is an interesting area, especially with how some are challenging the narratives and acquiring other tech. Index / Magnite / Pubmatic / OpenX are worth looking at.\nAgentic - pretty much every vendor is pivoting here and will need selling. But also means new players are appearing, especially in the planning / buying space\nCommerce - retail media is clearly the fastest growing medium with only CTV close, so plenty of newer networks or aggregators that need selling",
