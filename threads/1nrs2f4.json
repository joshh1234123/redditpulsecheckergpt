      "body": "As mentioned CTR and In-app is a terrible metric. Even CPI is pretty average as you'll find 90% of people won't even open the app.\n\nBest to optimise to at least a signup event in your MMP.\n\nDepends on your budget, but if you're spending over 15k, mise as well go with Moloco as that's their bread and butter. Kyzen is also decent but their flat rates fees are on the high size if your budget isn't big. If you're budget is under the 10k, prob better to stick with DV",

So the exact same article that would be determined unsafe on web is completely safe in-app. Alternatively, the entire app is deemed unsafe and the safe inventory is blocked and you miss out on scale. But even then, big apps can be overridden and marked safe regardless by DV or IAS at the request of the publisher.  ",
