They are given data by the social media platforms and they \"perform calculations\" and \"supply reporting.\" Do you think that would accurately report on invalid traffic, bots, fake accounts, viewability, etc?",

They will find fraud and IVT where there is none. \n\n\nWhat you SHOULD trust is analytics where the platform doesn't have incentives to find fraud where there is none or low to no fraud where there is fraud. And even then you should review the supporting data to \"see Fou yourself\" why something was marked IVT or not, and if you understand and agree with that. ",
