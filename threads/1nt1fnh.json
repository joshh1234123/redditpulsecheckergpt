That way, the sessions focus on what’s actually relevant instead of generic slides, cheap tricks & tips.  It’s not a $20 Udemy course, but you’re getting targeted sessions that actually line up with your stack and close strategic, technical, and commercial knowledge gaps.",

It is pretty unlikely someone new to programmatic would understand it from a single in person meeting / call, it will only stick if they have references to work with / look up after.\n\nAnd personally from experience don't dive into the platform straight away. Set the scene with what programmatic is, why it is important, how it differs to other channels & where it is going.\n\nWhen I was agency side, we'd do it like this:\n\n* Programmatic 101 / Intro\n* Programmatic buzzwords / acronyms\n* DSP overview topline\n* DSP deepdive including campaign build\n* Optimisation & Reporting\n* Advanced Optimisation\n* Measurement\n* Omnichannel impact of Programmatic\n\nEach would have some collateral / tests / practicals for the team to try understand it.",
