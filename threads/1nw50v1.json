      "body": "OMG this is soooo much cope from TTD. They could solve the TID issue for premium publishers tomorrow with one simple little UI tweak that has been possible for years (like at least the last 6+) yet they have hidden in the API never to let it see the light of day: Volume Control. Volume control essentially makes the DSP prioritize specific attributes for bid submission over others. They made a half ass version of it for Commitments, but the raw API version is a game changer in buying logic. It allows to you tier your supply properties even within a PMP to ensure you focus dollars/bids exactly where you want them. Want to make sure as much of your budget goes to vendors wit a TID? Volume control setting at 2 and drop all others to -1. You’ll only bid on the non TID supply when you absolutely have to to maintain pacing. \n\nWhy is TTD not making this simple UI tweak? Because TID isn’t about buyer transparency it’s about maintaining data infrastructure cost for TTD in their aging tech stack. If a pub sends 20x bid requests for the same impression that’s 20x the cost TTD needs to crunch in the exchange and store in post exchange processing that they don’t want eating into their margins. \n\nInstead of giving clients a simple and easy solution to force sellers to align to the buyers wants, they are convoluting the entire programmatic market with this mini-garden effort to shave 1% off their effective margin which they think keeps Wall Street happy, but somehow are ignoring that fact Wall St is plainly over TTD with the cuts analyst have given the company across the board. Wall Street analysts don’t care about this crap or Ventura OS, they want pure growth plain and simple. TTD is showing Wall St yet again its leadership is easily distracted by stupid esoteric fights instead of dealing with the increasing encroachment of Amazon. What a joke",

It’s the same thing Google did with the display market.\n\nInitially it promises more transparency and efficiency, but once the industry is operating on their platform, they have all the leverage and data and eventually begin to screw people over.\n\nWhenever they release something, I assume it’s more to serve themselves rather than serve everyone else in the market.",

OpenAds will be available for all other demand and supply side companies to bid into - but most of these companies won’t because it will reveal their exploitative nature and how little value they actually add for buyers or publishers.",
