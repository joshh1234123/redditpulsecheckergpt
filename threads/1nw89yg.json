      "body": "They are very good at sales. All of their PPTs are geared towards selling to people who are not familiar with digital.  Ex: [Travel](https://premion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PREMION-Why-CTV-OTT-for-Travel-Tourism.pdf). \n\nMy biggest issue with them is they are not trying to listen and setup a campaign for success, they are setting it up for their Ad Ops efficiency. This is especially true if you are running other channels thru your own house or thru other partners. An example of this would be you ask to run sports, they hear that and say SURE! Then your running on re-runs of games on Pluto (when you wanted NFL). Yes it's what you asked for, but they don't clarify or ask questions.  \n\nYou can make it work with them if the price is right, but be sure to ask for things like:\n\n* Hours (only 6am - 10pm) or whatever works for you.  \n* Full list of APPs they can run on (it will be limited) IE you want Paramount+ they may not be able to get you that. BUT they will have the Paramount logo on their presentations b/c their getting that inventory thru Pluto OR Fubo. \n   * Issue with them is their a corporation, most of the time they are not trying to go outside their own bubble of inventory. \n   * They probably are not going to setup custom campaigns for you either if they can't support it or they don't have the scale for it. \n* What networks / content / devices / apps you don't want to go on.\n* SETUP a KPI, If you can get them to place a pixel on whatever your tracking. \n* What audiences can they work with? 1st Party, 3rd party etc. Can they do Retargeting? \n   * Can they match the audiences you are using on other channels? \n   * Ask to the see the segments they are using IE they could be using [Mosaic Audiences ](https://assets.cengage.com/gale/help/dnow/DataMethodology/MosaicUSA_Handbook.pdf)when you wanted to target HH with $150k + & 2 kids.\n\nIn my experience they have some cool tools like the Arrivalist that you might not be able to get thru anyone else at a $10k budget. BUT you have to force them to give you what you want alot of the time. They are not going to be setting you up for success unless you walk them thru the process. \n\nFeel free to pull the plug if they bait and switch you. It's your biggest superpower.   \nHope that helps.",

      "body": "Honestly, it depends on what your goals are. Are you utilizing Managed Service, their audiences, or need thieir platform because you struggle with locality?  I haven’t worked with Premion directly, but from what I’ve seen, they’re really focused on DMAs and local campaigns. My sense is their CTV/OTT inventory isn’t hugely different from other SSPs- it looks to be less. The real question is whether you want to manage another UI just for CTV, or if you’d rather stick with an omnichannel solution that covers everything. Quite frankly you can get similar results with other non CTV focused companies. \n\nIf I were digging into them, I’d ask stuff like:\n\n\\- Are there any exclusive partnerships or inventory that actually set you apart?\n\n\\- Other vendors often struggle to scale DMA or zipcode targeting. How do you solve that where others can’t?\n\n\\- How transparent is your reporting? Can you see exactly which show and spot the ad ran on?\n\nDM me if you want to provide more info.",

If you’re buying it via a local station, they get some local NFL inventory but it’s primarily shoulder content. \n\nPremion used to be great for SMB/mid-market CTV. Their offering and model has changed dramatically and hasn’t kept up with the market. As others have said, there are far better partners and platforms worth exploring.\n\nFor context, I was part of the original GTM team for Premion and have been in the CTV space for 10 years.
