Seems like TTD knows that the adverse effect of poor performance will move dollars \\*away\\* so they intentionally keep buyers in the dark.\n\nBuyers (of the non-performance variety) \\*also\\* don't want this because it means their homework is graded.  Much easier to talk about CPG brand lift over several months/quarters than \"how many people clicked down funnel\" \n\nNo doubt there is value in banner advertising but the minute someone clicks on anything, everything downstream should be measurable back to ad spend.",

Neither DV360 (via dclid) or Amazon DSP go out of their way to do it, despite being more positioned vs TTD. Of course it is technically possible to do it but at the same time, how much does a click to 1st party cookie really mean in programmatic vs passing hashed PII. Then add in the crosswinds of click ids constantly being under threat from ITP / Apple changes, it is not exactly futureproof.\n\nHell even Criteo, the ultimate click based powerhouse doesn't go down that route and opts for more aggregated level variables.",
