Re the other items, all hear say so to your point could just be a pub or two sharing their own perspective that I’ve run into over the years. \n\nIt’s just often we see people default to assumptions here vs thinking more deeply about the fact everyone has a business to run, so whether open path or non, someone has to make money, and they aim to deliver enough value in excess of that money so that the end buyer has a net positive experience and invests more.
