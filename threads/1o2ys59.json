Amazon has different acceptance criteria for it's various supply sources so sometimes certain creatives will be approved for 3P exchanges, APS, and Amazon.com, but it will be prohibited for running on Echo Show devices or Fire TV etc. That's what I see this flagged the most for. \n\nI've also seen it for 3P ad tags being allowed to run on demographic or 3P audiences, but blocked from running against in-market or custom amazon audiences.",
