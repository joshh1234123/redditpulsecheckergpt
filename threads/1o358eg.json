Get into the nitty gritty of request flows, how monetization works, business models, etc.\n\nCons:  you see one narrow view of the world, vs. what the marketplace has to offer.  Many ill-informed views of how others in adtech operate.  Still chasing agency money.",

I think the comment on a narrow view is what you make it, if you have interest in learning usually the buissness will have someone touching that part externally. I have not regretted my choice to move from the buy side to a SSP.",

Figure out if this is the kind of company you would want to work for.\n\nThen think of role and scope - read the JD, think of it in the context of the company and decide if you want to do those things as your day to day.\n\nAfter that, think of the ecosystem and where this company fits and if you think they’re doing something you want to be a part of and you think has mid-long term prospects. Marketers will always need to spend money, does your prospective company have a good enough value proposition to capture some of it?\n\nIf the company seems good to work for and has a good role in the market and the JD fits what you want to do, then it just comes down to personal needs and preference.\n\nAd tech is as tech, you’ll get the chance to learn a lot by going into any part of the ecosystem you haven’t been before regardless of if it’s DSP/SSP/data etc. People on Reddit can be dogmatic about companies, many, many people on this sub are TTD shills trying to tell you Jeff Green will save the open internet and that Open Path is the body of Christ. These morons think TTD has most of the digital market share and all other ad tech companies are obsolete. Look at people’s comment history before weighing their perspectives.",
