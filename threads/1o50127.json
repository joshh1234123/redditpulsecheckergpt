      "body": "It's personal preference, inventory is dependent on what you and the client is comfortable with but you could use any combo you want. Personally the premium of higher quality inventory through PMPs would be worth it across funnel but that's up to you and you clients to decide. Some advertisers are cool with open auction across the board as long as viewability and other brand safety layers are in place. This allows additional scale and additional cost savings but questions remain on validity/intention of traffic.",

      "body": "Higher the funnel, the more quality inventory you'd want so more natural to do a PG / PMP only approach for Awareness. Consideration / Conversion can be more weighted towards open auction but dependent on what inventory / audience you are after, PMPs are still viable as are PGs.",
