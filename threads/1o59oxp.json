      "body": "know multiple people that have done all 3. never pick amazon unless you can't go anywhere else. Google is nice if you ever want to leave ads + wlb + perks + they are embracing ai in all aspects of work. that said it will probably always be an option down the line. you can network yourself wherever, probably retire there.\n\nttd is not where it was in say 2020 but theyre not going out of business anytime soon. if you are really passionate about ads and never want to leave ads, that's all they do. you need to politic to get anywhere. it's not so large that you can captain your own career on your own. wlb and perks are also pretty good though. lastly would i join right now though? id wait some months for us to see the real impact of amazon coming for them. there have also been a lot of changes that limit their exclusivity for almost everything that set them apart a few years ago.",

      "body": "A friend of mine works at Amazon, albeit a different department. She was told she had to move to Seattle or she no longer had a job, despite the fact when they hired her, they knew she didn’t live in Seattle. There are also reports of warehouse workers pissing in bottles because they get docked for going to the bathroom and a culture that prides itself on intentionally firing a certain percent of employees each year. My assumption is Amazon pays better, but everything I’ve heard, it’s an absolutely terrible place to work.\n\n5 years ago, TTD would have been the obvious answer. Since Kokai rolled out though, it seems like it’s not what it used to be. I’d probably still choose them of the 3, but it seems like a company and culture on the decline.\n\nGoogle seems like they don’t prioritize their DV360 team. It doesn’t seem as bad as Amazon, but I’d be worried about long term job security working in the ads department there.",

If work life balance is your most important factor, then TTD, but I also think the current hate on them right now is a little excessive and as a platform it can bounce back. Google I feel like is actively trying to get rid of reps and have advertisers rely on the adswerves, etc for platform support (at least this is the vibe I got in the US and could be wrong)\n\nIf you’re strictly talking about gaining experience at an agency to be a better trader, you should learn all 3.",

      "body": "I just made the move to TTD from a big publisher. Given what I’ve heard about Amazon, it wasn’t on my radar and I never heard back from Google.\n\nThe main reasons for leaving publisher side were compensation, new title, and relatively low risk of leaving. I think the downsides are that I will sacrifice some WL balance moving to TTD and also give up the possibility of moving out of advertising. Based on my conversations in my last role, most pivots outside of Ops/advertising would be lateral at best and most roles would be a minimum of 20K less per year. \n\nI just started so I don’t have much to say about TTD but my goal is to keep learning as much as I can and see where I get 1-2 years from now. For me, it came down to continuing my old role for 3+ years and counting or to having an immediate change",

That being said, the people, perks, and amount you will learn are hard to beat.\n\nLike others said, Google gives you a lot of mobility if you ever want to switch out of advertising and I have had a few friends move into fintech after leaving Google. The name carries weight on a resume. Keep in mind, nobody knows what is happening with the market and Google has never been afraid of layoffs.\n\nI have personally heard nothing but bad things about working at Amazon, but if you don’t care about work life balance then go there and make a bag",

And this was years ago when I actually had reps, it seems people I work with now often don't have a rep and need to use support only.\n\nAmazon I've heard horror stories of their company policies, work life balance. Not sure exactly on the DSP part but I'd steer clear.\n\nTTD is the only one I'd consider at this point.",

From prescription data (and because of that, insurance data) to what you watch to data they’ve mined from listening to Amazon echoes all over the fucking world, they have the data and pmp deals, and the capital and infrastructure to rapidly compete with any advantages TTD can try to combat with. Let’s not forget how much of the internet relies on aws for website hosting. Also, it may not seem like a big deal, but partnering with Spotify was a huge win for their continued dominance in the OTT ecosystem especially when you factor in the fact that they already crush the audiobook market and can now link even more data points between various accounts. Amazon music may not have the largest userbase, but partnering with the biggest one out there certainly has its advantages.",
