      "body": "I don't fully understand your question, unfortunately, but you could check out Filament or Pixability. They specialize in YouTube brand safety and prebid.\n\nAs for using multiple brand safety partners at once, I don't see a good use case for it, personally. It's all an imperfect science anyway, and if you're hoping to eliminate 100% of wasted impressions, you're going to be disappointed no matter how you do it.",

      "body": "Your second bullet confuses Pre & Post-Bid alongside whether you want to actively target on YouTube on a more curated manner vs post measurement impact of things like brand suitability / fraud / viewability etc.\n\nChannel Factory is predominately a pre-bid tool & works with IAS to offer some form of post-bid, but you'd need extra paperwork. DoubleVerify operates both (since they bought OpenSlate). Then there are more YT specific vendors in Zefr / Pixability etc. Some offer Channel level and some do Video / Keyword level.\n\nPost-bid is 2 parts: an UI scheduled report (which all the Pre-bid guys do) which has flaws. And for the more integrated approach, via ADH as a clean room which is more what the post-bid guys do but again with flaws.\n\nNothing is perfect, but for sure my recommendation is to run YT on an inclusion list where possible.",

      "body": "Being a walled garden, YouTube doesn't allow standard tagging like IAS and DV for other online video, so I don't think you could double-tag in that way. At their core, I believe most of these companies provide lists of YouTube channels that are \"good\" (allow list) and/or \"bad\" (block list), customized for each brand's needs. DV owns OpenSlate, a YouTube channel management company (custom allow lists) and there may be cost efficiencies if you use them elsewhere. Filament and Pixability mentioned by Lumiafan are worth checking out as well. Decide whether you want a full service buying solution or a tech tool to manage your channels when talking to these companies.\n\nThe options in Google are not great but have gotten a bit better; I would recommend excluding \"content suitable for families\" for any brand not targeting children. You can always run for a few days and see how terrible the placement reporting is (you'll probably be horrified). An allow-list approach is going to be safest but may impact delivery for small audiences.",
