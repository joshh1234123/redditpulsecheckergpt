      "body": "anyone can just add utm\\_source= to the url, so those are unreliable.  gclids are supposed to be automatically appended when the user clicks from a google search result. But bots have also copied entire urls with gclids and replayed them over and over. So while gclids are better than utm\\_source, you should still be vigilant and look for tell-tale signs of bot activity like way way too many pageviews for a single user (i.e. same gclid) and check this too [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/simple-advanced-attribution-fraud-how-detect-fouanalytics-fou-yit1e/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/simple-advanced-attribution-fraud-how-detect-fouanalytics-fou-yit1e/)",

SA360 is just applying CM360 tracking to Google Ads campaigns but this is focused on Search / PMAX / Demand Gen vs YouTube. If you want CM360 tracking on Google Ads YouTube, there are a couple of ways to do this separate to SA360.",
