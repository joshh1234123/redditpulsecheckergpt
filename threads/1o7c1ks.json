      "body": "DV360 is probably the best platform to get a start in because its so widely used globally. \n\nOnce you learn one platform its way easier to learn the others. Sure every platform has its own tweak on structure, navigation, nuances - but if you are just getting into programmatic learning how to traffic, manage, and optimize a campaign in any major DSP will give you a leg up on learning others.\n\nI'd recommend to look up best practices and generally follow them but don't be afraid to experiment (if you have the flexbility). Sometimes what people say in how to run campaigns won't always produce the best result for you and this is a great way to keep learning.",
