      "body": "I guess if an agency works with multiple platforms and they're all on adcp, this can simplify things a bit. Problem though is what's in it for the platforms? What's protecting customers from hallucinations (since it's using an LLM for interpreting the input, intent, and parameterization)? What recourse exist with respect to inaccurate or outdated information poisoning the context for a follow up request? We have enough trouble as it is with deterministic means (i.e. an in-house hub connected via API to platforms), why would those problems disappear by injecting a non-deterministic layer? Maybe I'm out of my technical depth here, would love for someone to help me understand the value proposition.",
