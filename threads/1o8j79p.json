      "body": "Yes and no. I've used it to find packaged inventory across multiple publishers for certain categories but not so much for single pubs.\n\nIf you are looking for top tier pubs then I'd say don't just think about price. When bidding into these pubs you are competing with their direct buys in the ad server. So if you want to bid low you'll get nothing or the scraps.\n\nIf you have a decent budget you can use the marketplace to contact the pub directly to setup a PMP.\n\nIf you don't have that much to spend and really just trying to get cheap inventory then just create a white list and bid low in the OX to see what you get. Win rates will be low but you might get some remnant inventory.",
