For now it's working in sandbox with test real website, website is connected to my prebid server (it is version from github, just added dsp adapter), and dsp is connected to this private prebid server and you can set up campaigns for this test site in dsp and see statistics. I can show you everything for free, you can connect your supply and play with that for a few months , I just need a feedback.",
