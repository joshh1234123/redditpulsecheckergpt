It’s just what some clients want, even though I recommend against it. Netflix isn’t doing much data pass back which limits attribution modeling and audience curation. A client is better off going through other major publishers like Disney, Warner Bros, Paramount, Sling, Etc. which offer the similar high quality inventory, but cheaper, better audience targeting, and attribution data.",
