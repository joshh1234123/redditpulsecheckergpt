It's not going to show you the floor price directly, but it gets you closer to understanding if your bid is too low.",

      "body": "So on our side, we yield optimize to get where we need to be for price / performance (bid wise). Not using dv360, but our own stack. We see this every Monday as everything gets loaded and by mid week it starts to down-price. Now that we’re approaching holidays, the bid usually gets higher towards weekends as well (at least for the pubs we’re working with) as we get closer to BFCM and Xmas in general.",
