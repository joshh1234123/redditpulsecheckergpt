The main reason for a PG deal is that you're getting already guaranteed inventory which is normally the most premium. Trying to add any filters could cause the deal to break and not even spend.",

You’ll overblock/overfilter quality inventory for no good reason.\n\nThe DSP brand safety works for general open market buys where you have no clue on the quality across thousands of domains/apps.",

Also it’s not recommended to filter, the idea of a PG is that the third party assure this for you. If you do layer, it can give pacing and bid rejections due to incompatible ad calls",
