I think it’s going to be more about use cases. \n\nI work with some clients that want to make a splash around conferences and run campaigns that start in the airports, then run in the Uber/Lyft, around the conference center at night and then same thing on the way back to the airport.\n\nAlso have retail clients that want to be on digital bill boards within a certain radius of their brick and mortar. \n\nI had a college that wanted to be on bus routes to and from specific high schools. \n\nAnd then the fun part with attribution comes in also. Which can be fun! \n\nIf you have some specific use cases feel free to DM me and I can give you an idea.",

You can also spin up bespoke landing pages I guess, to capture users who type in the dominant phrase on the DOOH billboard, and then click through from search? \n\nOther than that, it’s kinda like putting sponsor logos on a NASCAR racer.  They are there, they are persistent, and the lift mostly gets inferred.",
