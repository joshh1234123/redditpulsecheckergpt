I saw that Amazon DSP's cumulative reach metric also \"accounts for coviewing\", so it has most likely a similar methodology. \n\nHowever, you will not be able to unify reach across DSP, as reach won't be deduplicated.",

      "body": "Yes deduplication is my biggest worry but atleast having a dashboard that tracks reach across all DSPs would be a start. My main use cases are for CTV - do you think co-view is a better metric that just reach or house hold reach? Does TradeDesk support co-view as well? I think all platforms have reach. Thinking of one reach number that is common across all DSPs. DV360 does not have Household, TradeDesk does not have just reach and I am unsure about Amazon.",
