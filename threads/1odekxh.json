Programmatic is largely on first price whereas a lot of the non-programmatic platforms still operate on a mix.\n\nBut if you are after the more technical side of things in terms of things like bid shading / QPS, that is a bit more adops led. Or if you just want to know how to use a DSP hands on, that is challenging without access via a reseller / agency.\n\nI'll be releasing some standard basic programmatic training soonish on a separate note.",
