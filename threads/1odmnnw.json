      "body": "Weewwww welcome to the conveyor belt.\n\nFirstly, the big thing here is, focus on what are YOU getting out of this job? Is it learning pace? Is it learning process? Is it learning how to consult with clients? Is it media excellence, is it \\*business\\* knowledge?\n\nTo get the most out of agency, you have to take a step back and really focus on what your \\*role\\* is in the business, and also understand how that role ladders up to what is really a giant money making machine.\n\nI've just finished 5 years and am getting out of agency now, but it's the place that has taught me more than I ever could have imagined. The real key is just figuring out how to make it work for you, and stopping every now and then to take stock of what you've learned.\n\nMore recently, I've gotten behind the scenes of how agencies make money, and, it's not pretty.\n\nTwo answer your two biggest questions\n\nThe pace and resource problem, big learning for me was, always ask yourself \"is this what my client asked for?\". Never add complexity to a process or solution, without there being commercial benefit. ie, if you pull together an advanced presentation for a client that they didn't ask for, then have a think about the trade off there. Yes it might be the best solution, but are you or the agency getting commercial benefit from that? Or would the more basic solution deliver comparable results, without adding complexity to process. When analysing your clients issues, tackle the low effort, high reward problems first, and move from there. Same goes in your internal processes, what small changes can have the largest impact?\n\nThose publisher biases you talk about, have a re-think about what optimal look likes. If your agency has $1million committed to a publisher, and that commitment helps unlock a 20% discount agency wide on a market rate, then your contribution to that commitment, \\*is\\* directly benefiting your client. The value in agencies is pooling spend to unlock efficiency. So when you're comparing Publisher A vs Publisher B, and one is an 95th percentile solution, and one is a 90th percentile solution, ask yourself if that 5 percentile points is worth \\*not\\* contributing to the agency deal, and helping preserve that favorable rate position for all clients.\n\nAll in all, agencies can be absolutely awful at times, but just focus on what \\*you\\* are learning. There's so much to learn, and so much of it is incredibly valuable for your journey, just make sure you're conscious what you're getting out of it.",

Having a gratitude journal helped me because if you can’t get out, gotta find things to be thankful for because the pace and insanity rarely ever let up or change even when you try to make change. You can try to make a case for change by presenting your ideas and why they would be beneficial but it takes massive effort to move the mindset of a client and team so gotta pick your battles or you’ll burn out",

This stuff can get super complicated and eyes glaze over fast so learning when to speak up and how to say it can go a very long way. \n\nI know it doesn't feel glamorous while you're in it, but the cache that comes with having those names on your resume is invaluable to the progression of your career. Or at least it was for me. \n\nEnd of the day, this is AdTech. We're not saving lives. Be the best tigger you can be, but make sure you set your boundaries so you don't burn out.",

Something else you may notice, depending on the culture of your last place, is that many things seem like ‘life and death’. \n\nThey’re not. It’s just advertising. And your VP wants another bonus",

      "body": "It's the harsh reality of working for a holdco level agency, both in terms of work culture and pressure as well as the corporate back scratching. However, this early in your career this is still a valuable learning experience as you're exposed to so many elements of the digital marketing world. Use this opportunity to develop yourself and try and grow, agencies are a great place to gain managerial experience early in your career. From there you can start to explore which path(s) may better align with your interests in the industry. \n\nJust remember we're not saving lives and any client that pretends it's the end of the world when deadlines are missed is ridiculous",

      "body": "I've been in your position (EU too) and used that experience to grow my career.\n\nYes agencies can operate in difficult ways. In programmatic you're exposed to that and the data side of things - so it's one of the best places to learn fast, even if it's tough to begin with.\n\nE.g. Right now it might be annoying to prioritise certain publishers but as another post said - it's part of a wider commercial package. And if you're managing a brand in 5 years time it's good to know what the agency will be doing behind the scenes.\n\nThe best people I've seen flourish at agencies streamline their day to day tasks or take ownership of an SOP / process (think automating reports or QA, troubleshooting, mediaplanning etc.) that saves everybody time. Then use that time you've regained to explore the bits you're really interested in. Happy to help further, if you drop me a private message.",

Just do your best and learn the ropes. It took me a while but the knowledge I’ve gained is immeasurable. I feel I’ve learned the most from those stressful moments, mistakes, etc. \n\nThe firefighting is something I feel on the daily. It’s like some big problem or need comes up every other day and it’s very stressful but hopefully you have a good team you can lean on.",
