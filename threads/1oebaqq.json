For example, Meta and Google match rates are likely much higher than StackAdapt since they own verified, login data, and don’t need to go through hoops to resolve these lists to online identities.  Amazon, too, and Yahoo to a large extent.",

Unfortunately this first job I'm bringing them has the lowest budget for programmatic of any political campaign I've worked with (\\~$1500) so it feels a bit awkward asking them to put hours into figuring this out. I have let them know I'd like to bring bigger-spending campaigns to them in the future to sweeten the pot a bit though.\n\nI set up an account with DSPolitical since they are often recommended in the political space, but their CPMs are insanely high to the point of nearly being a scam and their tools and options are extremely limited.",

They seem reputable enough that they *should* be giving better results, but if you know of other providers that have more reliable partners, or an affordable intermediary service that I can run the data through before bringing it to stackadapt, I would be love suggestions!",

Typical use case for having multiple providers is to use one as a primary, and the second provider only processes the identities unresolved by the first.  No one runs the full list through both vendors, it’s too costly.\n\nIn your case, Experian is the better of the two.  Experian relies on CC data, so you should better matches to names and addresses.  LR is cookie-based and can sometimes be hot garbage.",
