      "body": ">- The industry burned billions preparing for a “cookieless future” that was never really about cookies.\n\nI legit still have a full built ad tech stack (very barebones) that we didn't even bother to peruse looking for VC for. It uses a system that's totally cookieless. We thought that if cookies were legitimately phased out, that there was at least a glimmer of hope that a competitor could compete.\n\nWe built tech for nobody because Google lied.\n\nI mean, I guess it's our own fault, I know multiple people involved in the project knew they were total scum bags... We're talking about the real drama too... Like how their empire of click fraud operates and how the government protects them because they spy on the entire planet for them. (See Edward Snowden.)\n\nI mean seriously: How much more market manipulation are we suppose to put up with? It's up, down, left, right coming from Google. They've proven that they can not be trusted under any circumstances...\n\nSo, they used their lies about trying to fix their tech, to prevent competition by trolling us? Sigh man... This stuff has to stop dude...\n\nI'm serious: A few years ago I made the hard decision to never work with that company again in any capacity and my life has gotten a lot better since then... I'm very serious about that... They're not making the world a better place or close to it.\n\nI mean seriously, I went from search optimization, to search tech, to ad tech, and now I'm moving on to something else. Is Google going to allow people to ever have a stable life, or are just they just going to keep disrupting everything, so nothing can be stable? So, only they can \"navigate the waters?\"",

      "body": "Not sure I agree with all of the commentary tbf. Privacy Sandbox got flak because its Google but you have to give them credit for 1) enabling some of those more security specific proposals like CHIPS to getting wider adoption (which isn't deprecating) & 2) at least attempting to engage 3rd parties with the proposals vs Apple bluntly releasing ATT / SKAN / PCM.\n\nFor ads, attention will now be on whether W3C will adopt a browser level attribution mechanism, which is a big deal if it happens. Privacy Enhancing Tech is still relevant & depending on legacy IDs like 3P cookies or last click measurement is pretty silly at this point too for any brand / agency.",
