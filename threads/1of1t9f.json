And now seems they've just dumped in more third party tools. Not much point really. Why would you pay more for something you can build in house based on your brand or company data. AI will bring in efficiencies but will turn everything into sameness for all brands and produce ineffective creative that isn't tailored for that platform - eg ad on tiktok needs to be very different on YT. Media is going more in house, and they're missing what they used to be great at - creative. They should double down on creativity models that is hybrid agency in house with quick turn around production blend of human and AI.",
