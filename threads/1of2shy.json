The real gap is that media owners think OOH should be the next big thing but no insight into why Brands/Agencies don’t believe it is because it’s a brand awareness play regardless of the screen type. \n\nPeople also don’t want or need an over exposure of a brand. If I’m getting a Walgreens app notification, Walgreens ctv Ad, walk out side and see a fucking bicycle with a screen on it I’m going to throw brick",

It has always been about reach and impact at scale.\n\nThe problem starts when “awareness” is reported with precision-style metrics that don’t really exist. That creates unrealistic expectations on both sides. If we define OOH success clearly — awareness uplift, recall, or local engagement — and measure only what can actually be verified, credibility goes up immediately.\n\nThe issue isn’t that OOH drives awareness. It’s that we’ve blurred the line between what’s measurable and what’s just assumed.",

On one hand with the industry expanding they have to onboard screens the others were but at the same time they knew that a lot was awful. As a buyer, buying urinal screens is funny at first then it’s the literal toilet of inventory. It has a place, but you can’t be banging on about DOOH being the new format when it’s a rounding error of some for some of these DSP’s. \n\nPeople in the industry over hype DOOH because they have a massive stake in it. So obviously bias but I found my time in it fun I just think the ceiling for DOOH is much much lower than those in it realise",

The issue isn’t that OOH can’t be measured, it’s that we often promise more than what can actually be verified.\n\nIf everyone — agencies, publishers, and advertisers — is clear that OOH is primarily an awareness and perception driver, it becomes easier to set honest expectations.\n\nBrand lift studies, footfall proxies, and recall surveys all have value as long as they’re used consistently and transparently. The problem is when they’re mixed with inflated “impact” numbers that look scientific but aren’t.\n\nAwareness is powerful on its own. It just needs to be presented with truth, not theatre.",
