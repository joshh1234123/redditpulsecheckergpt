      "body": "There are companies giving day shift as an option, most of WPP media works on day shift, you can try for some role there. People actually struggle to get into Programmatic, it's a niche that will only grow in India. SEO and other digital marketing channels are mostly on decline, give it some time I feel... perhaps with day shift.",

      "body": "The issue with programmatic is its entry barrier. To have access to DV360 or any of the big DSPs there are budget minimums that small companies can't go with.\n\nThis is both good and bad, because on the hand you are strugling with night shifts but on the other you are a harder to find professional than if you were just ppc manager for example.\n\nYou could try to find a large advertiser based in your timezone or in India for example.\n\nOr you could pivot and switch to affiliate marketing media buying (nutra, mvas, sweepstakes, casino etc etc etc). I know for certain that India is a huge market for that and lots of companies there, but forget the programmatic advertising you have known as you would probably switch to more shady formats.",

But how do I make that transition?",
