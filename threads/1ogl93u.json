Features and UI changes with advanced tech and as per USP of the DSP.\n\nOptimsations - if you have experience of basic optimization than you are good to go. Because with lot of A/B testing and experience you will find new ways of optimization.\n\nBasics are Placements, audience segments, bid changes, media mix, etc. I can add 20 more.",
