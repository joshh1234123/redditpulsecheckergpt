If it is a step up for you, what Amazon typically does is fire somebody who’s in a senior role who is making a good salary and then try to replace them with an ambitious junior and pay them peanuts. \n\nIf you are willing to stretch into a role that you may not be absolutely qualified for, but are willing to endure some growing pains, then this might be good for you. \n\nJust know that as you progress in your career and get promoted and make more money, Amazon increasingly hates you and wants to slaughter you.",

This is the way of the world.  \n\nOr, turned into a haiku by Gemini AI:\n\nSome people come in.\n\nOthers must move on.\n\nThe wheel turns for all.",

Ask them why they just laid off 600 people, and what the long-term plans are for the division you’re getting hired into. \n\nNever forget: you are vetting THEM just as much as they are vetting YOU. If they get nasty about being questioned, or are evasive, then take that into consideration, because that is a very dark signal as to what the job situation is going to be like.",
