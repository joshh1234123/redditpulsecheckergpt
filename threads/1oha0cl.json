      "body": ">Very high number  is not necessairly specific.\n\n That's not very specific. It can be completely normal. \n\n>As a user, I would normally click an ad like that (if only to not lose the discount URL), so it’s odd to see people supposedly converting without clicking.\n\nCompletely wrong. This is pretty much 2010 digital marketing mindset that forgets you cannot click on cable tv ads.  Attribution is a very complecated and deep branch of marketing, not a topic to be closed with 'I would normally click an ad'.\n\n  \nOverall, your post contains many presumptions that you may not even be aware of. I think you are relatively new to digital.  You are asking if x is normal, then assuming that there is some 'inflation' happening.\n\n>what’s the best way to confirm that the impressions truly come from DV360 and not from another channel that might be firing the same Floodlight tag\n\nThis is just nonsense. Are you really asking if there is somebody who knows you are running a campaign via DV360, is reapeadetly creating new cookies to be caught by rtg setup in DV360, and then goes to the website to PURCHASE something? I would be very happy if I had someone permanently purchasing shit from my clients lol.",

      "body": "Programmatic / DV360 by default will optimise to both post impression & post click conversions, which when paired with standard last touch attribution will mean 90% of conversions will not require a click. This is quite normal.\n\nIf you want to optimise / measure programmatic on a click only basis to compare it to a search / social world, you can adjust your bidding / floodlights to factor that in. But in reality it is not the smartest thing to do, given the role of programmatic buying in general. It will never outperform other channels on a last click basis and on the flip side, plenty of those post impression conversions are likely non-incremental. But there is a middleground where it is viable.",

      "body": "Yes, this is a typical observation when reviewing Programmatic campaigns. View throughs will always account for the majority of your conversions. Putting yourself in the average person's shoes, most people just do not click on ads (assuming display in this case). It's better to view these as online billboards that increase ad exposure and can perform well as an \"assist\" in the user journey. \n\nYou could experiment with your creative to try to call out that a click is the only way to get the discount if you are  not doing that already.",

What are you optimizing towards to?\n\nCould be that people see the adz remember they added the product on the cart, and went directly to the site to finish it.\n\nWhat is unclear to me is, are you stating in the ad that the discount is only applied if you click? because the user might expect to find the discount on the website when returning and that's it.\n\nIf you or your team are runing also search ads, ask them if they saw a spike in sales for the typical brand campaign since you started the retargeting or since you noticed this.",
