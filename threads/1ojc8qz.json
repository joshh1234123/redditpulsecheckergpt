      "body": "Amazon can take jabs at the other two all they want. Nobody in the press will talk about how crap their platform is, because they're not the ones in it. It constantly crashes every browser. It is not flexible with complex audiences or geotargets which you have to recreate every single time. It's invoicing systems are broken. It's reporting interface and features are one of the worst I've ever seen.\n\nEveryone who speculates that Amazon is going to take massive market-share has not been in their platform to set up media. I can not imagine a fortune 500 advertiser who can function in that thing and run massive national media campaigns.\n\nOh and now their core day to day support teams are gone.",

But Amazon is losing every front because they dont do things right, only care to undercut competitors prices avoiding taxes, but in Ad spending, the cheapest is not better. They can give their services for free, but they Will fk their customers when the time comes, Just look at their shutdown on mmo gaming, fkn their costumers who invested time and money, then aws services keep crashing and more expensive, Amazon retailers having expensive fees each year. Its a predatory Company who doesnt have Bezos insights anymore... Fk Amazon indeed.",
