      "body": "Local businesses probably fair better doing search and social, truthfully. Programmatic using retargeting to remind users who’ve engaged in some way is probably better, and CTV of course.\n\nEnsuring in search you know which competitors are in the same space and being placed alongside those with a strong offering, message.\n\nProgrammatic, imo, is great for general awareness but if you’re looking for someone to see an ad and call from purely programmatic you might not net the results you want.",

      "body": "Programmatic is just throwing money into the blind.  The inventory you want is priced out for small businesses because it's being gobbled up by large brands.  If you can do targeted CTV buys locally it probably is your best bet, but you're in IT which in and of itself is a niche industry.\n\nI'm helping a few clients right now with exactly this - in finserv, real estate, and CPG.  At local / small scale you're unfortunately stuck with Search and Social.  Your best bet is to run a few tests and really hone your keywording and headlines / descriptions. On social a/b test with some creatives.  You might have some more luck with video on social, and think about TikTok.  There's a point of diminishing returns especially at the local level because there's only so many people you can target who would realistically engage with your brand.",

Great to hear real experiences after all the trial and error.\n\nStreaming works, but it’s about looking at the full picture — direct attribution, incremental growth like branded search lift, organic traffic, and how brand awareness affects conversions and cart value compared to those who didn’t see the ads.\n\nHow are you attributing leads with pixel on top of phone calls?\n\nLocal targeted streaming makes a lot of sense once brands hit diminishing returns on search and social. We’re seeing strong results for local businesses at that stage.\nEspecially for products or services with wide appeal and $200+ cart value.",

As someone who works in CTV, I've been a proponent of democratizing the channel for SMB and not just large brands.\nCheck out streamr.ai where you can create 30sec spots for $0 and modify them for not much more.  I don't directly benefit from promoting this but will if the SMB market buys more ads!",

With Streaming TV, even when i watch the apps I am featured on. I am the \"only\" tech related business on TV so i feel like less concern with competition.",

My website form asks how they heard of us and we ask people in-person and over the phone. Since doing TV streaming more consistently my call volume has increased and I keep getting tagged in FB posts and people are privately DM me saying how cool it was to see a local biz on TV. I know I need to focus on better measuring but im doing it for now to get the word out.",
