Advertisers should really be moving away from Viewability as a KPI in 2025 in any case. I’m pretty certain the vast majority of case studies done on the subject have shown that Attention and Viewability are not intrinsically correlated and Attention is the real metric you want to focus on to drive high engagement.",
