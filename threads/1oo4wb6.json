SSP viewability is usually measured pre bid. DSPs typically measure post render. Ad blockers are often the biggest reason why. \n\nIf I were communicating with a client about it, I’d try to avoid being defensive (you come across like you know your numbers are overinflated) and instead position yourself as curious.",
