      "body": "Monks, Adswerve, and Jellyfish are all good options if you’re moving to a reseller setup. They’ve got solid DV360 experience and good support. \n\nIf you’re already looking at those, you might also want to check out [getadlib.com](http://getadlib.com/). Our platform connects to all the major DSPs (including DV360) and can help make the switch from a direct seat a lot easier.\n\nFWIW, DV360 can be a bit tough for political campaigns because of the compliance side, but for public sector and non-political work, it’s usually fine.\n\n*Disclaimer: I’m the founder of AdLib.* ",

Our rep at the reseller was actually more knowledgeable of the dsp and capabilities than actual google reps when I started to work with them. \n\nThe reseller team could actually help fix a problem or point you in the right direction. Actual google team will tell you to submit a help ticket every…..single…..time…..",
