Strong intent signals from authenticated channels with mechanisms to buy-it-now and never visit a retailer's site? It's half the reason companies are injecting so much into this.. either land grabs or attempting to hold what they have already.\n\nSEO is already moving toward making the web discoverable to bots for presentment (the semantic web the academics talked about.. now a commercial necessity).\n\nYou'll get sponsored content, sponsored follow-up questions, and sponsored rankings.  It's clean now.. enjoy it while it lasts.",
