      "body": "If you like Basis for the workflow and PMP access but are running into API and support issues, you've got a few solid directions to go.\n\nSome agencies transition to DV360 or The Trade Desk, but these platforms can feel heavier operationally, and you'll still encounter some integration quirks. Others look at reseller-connected platforms that offer similar flexibility without the tech overhead.\n\nIf that's the route you're considering, you should check out [getadlib.com](http://getadlib.com). Our platform connects to every major DSP, including DV360 and Amazon, and is built to simplify cross-platform buying and integrations.\n\nFWIW, we've heard from numerous teams that are leaving Basis for similar reasons, primarily due to concerns about API stability and account support.\n\n*Disclaimer: I'm the founder of AdLib.*",
