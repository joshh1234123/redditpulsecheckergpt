Others look at reseller-connected platforms that offer similar flexibility without the tech overhead.\n\nIf that's the route you're considering, you should check out [getadlib.com](http://getadlib.com). Our platform connects to every major DSP, including DV360 and Amazon, and is built to simplify cross-platform buying and integrations.\n\nFWIW, we've heard from numerous teams that are leaving Basis for similar reasons, primarily due to concerns about API stability and account support.\n\n*Disclaimer: I'm the founder of AdLib.*",
