If your audience is looking at this from a billing POV what will matter is breaking down your data in a way that closely mirrors outgoing/incoming payments. In my experience they dgaf about much else in terms of vanity metrics. \n\nIf we’re talking about a non-billing POV - I’d start by working backwards from the KPIs of your programmatic buy. Was it to drive awareness at low CPMs? Highlight total delivery & low rates to achieve it. Cherry pick some top sites/media types to showcase where it delivered. \n\nPerformance programmatic / high engagement tactics? Highlight strong CPAs etc. Break out media types that performed better than others. ",
