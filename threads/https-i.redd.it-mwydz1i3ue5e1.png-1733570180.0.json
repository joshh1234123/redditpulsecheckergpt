I really do appreciate insights like these and feel the industry should be more open to discuss flaws in the technology that are used by advertisers. What would make these better is if there is more on how we can adjust strategies and campaign setups to help mitigate results like this?",

Performance max places your ads on search partners (mostly bots) and the display network, which is full of click fraud websites.\n\nWe know people on the Google Ads' teams and they tell us Google makes a low effort to detect bots. I remember one of the engineers telling us it'd be career suicide if he wrote code to detect click fraud bots.\n\nThe reason the bots try to generate fake conversions is because that tricks Google into thinking they're humans. There's two nasty side effects: \n\n1. The fake conversions train Google to send you more bots.\n\n2. Since many of the fake conversions are spam leads, and the bots usually use real people's data when submitting the spam leads, if you store or contact the leads, and the leads complain, it's a $40k fine per lead.\n\nThat's why we recommend you use bot detection and disabling if you advertise online.\n\nIf you're new to this topic, head over to r/clickfraud",
