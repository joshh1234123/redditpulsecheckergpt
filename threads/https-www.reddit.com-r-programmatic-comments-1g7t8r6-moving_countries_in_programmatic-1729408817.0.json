      "body": "Do you have the right to work in another country?\n\nFor me when hiring this is the first step when looking at candidates, if you're trying to get sponsorship I'm afraid it's not a specialist enough role I'm not able to hire anyone who doesn't have their own right to work.\n\nOtherwise I'd be looking for people who have the skills, knowledge of the industry but most of all a willingness to learn.\n\nYou mentioned a 'Manager' role, do you mean as an 'account manager' or a 'people manager' job titles can vary across the industry and I'd say there is a distinction that with 2+ years experience I'd look and 'Account Manager' type roles (titles may vary here though) where you are managing accounts/campaigns but not a role in management of people.\nThis might vary though especially in smaller companies if you did really want to manage people.",

They recently increased the salary requirements, and pay in programmatic especially early years wouldn’t meet this threshold. I am trying to switch jobs too for better pay but companies don’t want to sponsor anyway.",

I worry that 2+ years may not be enough experience for employers to consider sponsorship. My advice would be to gain more experience and manage your work visa, as someone suggested. Simply handling campaign execution or communication isn’t enough — you need to develop skills in strategy, planning, execution, optimization, client management, and team leadership.",

They welcome a lot of expats and most of the biggest DSPs have the HQ there. \n\nIf you approach any DSP there and help them expand their take on India, they will welcome you with open arms. personally as I have my own company in programmatic media trading, I chose Lisbon portugal (sun, beach, good peeps and good taxes). Here is the list of the best DSPs in Europe : [https://blog.tedjordan.org/advertising/platforms/best-dsps-programmatic-advertising/](https://blog.tedjordan.org/advertising/platforms/best-dsps-programmatic-advertising/)\n\nIn this field, the contacts do everything though so see if you know somewhere in a country you like and check if they can help you out. All the clients I have come from recommendations from my contacts ;)",
