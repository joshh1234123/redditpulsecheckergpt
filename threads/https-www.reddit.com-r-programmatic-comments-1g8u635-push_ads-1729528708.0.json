      "body": "Hi guys! That's right, [push notification ads](https://adsterra.com/blog/push-notification-advertising/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=comments) are not SMS, but browser or app-based notifications that appear directly on the user’s device. Push traffic can be legitimate if sourced from trusted ad networks.\n\nPush ads are popular because they combine high visibility with user opt-ins, which means users choose to engage in something and complete an action.\n\nFor example, Adsterra [push notification ad network](https://adsterra.com/blog/best-push-notification-ad-networks/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=comments), offers In-Page Push ads with real-time tracking, targeting, and anti-fraud measures. More to say, In-Page Push type of ads, a new generation of push ads, have up to 30X higher CTRs than web push ads, which is a great bonus.",
