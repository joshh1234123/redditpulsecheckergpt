When you select in feed or shorts, the preview will still show a regular video ad because the platform is mediocre.\nYou will need to reach out to Google support or to a representative and ask them to force a preview on the desired ad format. I requested this a long time ago and at that time even the rep told me that their available tool had been deprecated lol.",
