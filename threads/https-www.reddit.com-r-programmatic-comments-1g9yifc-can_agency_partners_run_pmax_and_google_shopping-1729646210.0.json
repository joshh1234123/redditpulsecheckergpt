      "body": "The second paragraph from cuteman is best: by owning the Google Ads account and having the agency just manage campaigns within, you maintain the campaign data & learnings, can keep an eye on activity/performance to make sure they’re lifting their weight, ensure an easier transition if you switch to another agency in the future, potentially qualify your business for dedicated Google Account Manager support rather than their business (if you spend enough over time), and maintain any conversion tracking setups if you part ways with the agency (although this last one can in theory be managed via your MCC aka My Client Account).\n  \nKeep in mind how the billing/financial side will be agreed between you and the agency, as it may be that the agency uses their financial details and then raises a purchase order/insertion order with you to bill you for media & services. Better to have the agency keep their financial details in the accounts if possible, so that if they erroneously overspend by loads it’s both their fault and their issue with creditors.  \n  \nYou may then want to consider linking the ad account with your other Google properties, like Google Analytics 4 and a YouTube channel, which can be useful for retargeting and providing Pmax campaigns with purchase/lead data as an audience signal to empower its machine learning capabilities.",
