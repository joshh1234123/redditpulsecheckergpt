If your clients are showing up on non-brand safe sites that’s like… really messed up and the agency has a responsibility to protect the brand. \n\nSome DSPs have already built in “brand safe” rails that you don’t need to implement when building a campaign but seeing as the reports are sounding alarms for you I’d probably just say something like “hey so I noticed in the reports we’re not showing up on brand safe sites, do you want me to make a negative inventory list or maybe we can meter in brand safety?” I wouldn’t even present it as an option to not have it imho.",

Also, agency people hate being challenged internally, so enjoy that. If you're in it for the money only, you have your answer.\n\nMaybe just a note that keyword exclusion is a dinosaur way to approach brand safety mechanisms (not that most 3P verification services don't operate based on that model).",

It’s the agency’s duty to educate them and make them aware of the risks. It might also be by design though, and they are aware and still don’t care. \n\nYou won’t know if you don’t ask. \n\nBut don’t make it a “recommendation”. Just ask about it internally and see what he says.",

You don't have to do it in a accusatory way but you can just mention the bad content on reports you've been seeing but also ask if there is a general reason why there isn't a standardised approach to applying brand safety.

In my experience at large agencies, they have the most to lose and tend to stand up full teams to develop a brand safety strategy that can get to the point of essentially running direct IO.  Its the smaller agencies and clients that have less restrictions and will use platforms like Criteo (who's inventory quality and controls are horrible) to stretch their dollar with dirt cheap CPMs.\n\n  \nOP - I would suggest escalating internally - this could be something that is isolated to a few accounts but leadership would likely want to know.  I would start with keyword and site block lists, IAS or DV pre-bids then expand from there.  But the first and most important step is escalating internally.  TBH it will only make your life harder, and cause more work if its not fixed and the client catches the issue.",
