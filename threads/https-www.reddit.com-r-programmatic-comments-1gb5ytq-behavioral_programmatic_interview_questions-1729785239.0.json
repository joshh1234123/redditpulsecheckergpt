      "body": "I'm somewhat familiar with that kind of hiring process. The questions are usually framed around your personal experiences at jobs that fit the prompt, like \"tell me about a time you had a disagreement with a supervisor\" or \"What is a difficult problem that you've solved while working for ______\". If its a multi-day process they might also be digging into theoretical scenarios, like \"What would you do if...\", personality tests, or thought experiments, like \"How much does this building weigh\". I'm not the biggest fan of the last two, they have rightly been phased out of a lot of hiring processes, but are still pretty common. \n\nThat doesn't rule out specific questions on programmatic infrastructure, depending on how knowledgeable the recruiters are, but I think the important thing to do is be able to concisely explain the experience in each job on your CV and how it relates to the position you're going for. My only other suggestion is having a few stories on hand to cover the basics, roughly: \n\n- Mistakes you've made, what you learned from them\n\n- Disagreements, personal conflict, and how you reacted to or dealt with them\n\n- Achievements, things you have accomplished\n\n- Team work, how you have worked together with others towards some common goal\n\n- And, if you're going to have direct reports, they'll probably want to hear something about your management style\n\nGood luck!",

Do not make up stuff if there is not at least plausible deniability.\n\nA certain amount of exaggeration is expected and accepted in an interview setting.\n\nOutright lying about something that not only didnt happen but could not have happened, is a very different matter and will likely come back to bite you in the butt eventually.",
