      "body": "Am I pacing okay? If so, after 2 weeks:\n\n* aggressively cut inventory (sites and even SSPs, but since your using DV360 that doesn't matter that much since its 99% google). I just block inventory outright and do not use bid factors. It's a waste of time.\n* Look at ad environment and device type. I use bid factors here but only bid down. 9/10 times I block in-app inventory. Story of my programmatic life.\n* shift budget around to best performing audience\n\nThen keep doing that on a weekly cadence\n\nAfter 30 days\n\n* pull a conversion details report if available (it is in TTD). find the average # of impressions it takes to convert. look at your campaign frequency and adjust based on those numbers\n* look at creative versions (not ad formats). remove lower performing creative versions, and get more cycled in in 60-90 days\n\nI ignore geo, ad formats, time of day, basically anything else.\n\nIf not pacing okay:\n\n* add additional audience segments that are relevant to your original target audience. This is the only way to really add scale without changing the PMPs.\n* Or, you adjust fcaps. If you're only targeting 1x per day/week, it's very likely that your not even penetrating your target audience well enough anyway for them to even know to make a conversion. Serve them more ads.\n\nAnother thing to open up inventory is looking at viewability. If it is in the 80-90% range, be open to moving it down to the 70% range. I've lowkey found that highly viewable placements does not equal more conversions. Like a lot people ignore top of the fold ads, especially if they are reading an article. Even though a placement has a higher average viewable %, it doesn't mean its impactful.\n\nOther things to consider, How many average conversions happen on the site per day? might be that there just isn't that much activity on the site and you have an unattainable goal.",

      "body": "This is great! I’d add that view ability should be optimized on cost not %. Changing that approach drastically reduces overall cpm and if you approach site list with vCPM vs %, you’ll see a huge reduction in cpa cost. The volume gain on impressions will be worth the reduction in overall cpm. 2 weeks is a bit long for my liking though.  Depending on how much you’re spending, you have enough data after a few days to start changing things. Of course all depends on the conversion goal and attribution window.",

      "body": "Great advice!\n\nJust want to add: don’t completely eliminate the use of bid factors/multipliers. Keep it in your back pocket. If you are pacing fine and have unlimited scale, sure. Forget them. \n\nBut if you are struggling to scale, you can try a 25% to 75% bid factor on some of the underperforming inventory. This will push spend towards the performers and reduce the CPA of the underperforming inventory.",

But when you are looking at conversions via a time of day report, it's attributing the conversion to when the purchase occurred, not when the last impressions was served, which is more valuable IMO. If someone saw an ad on a Saturday, but purchased on Monday, why would I want to serve more ads on a Monday by bidding up?",
