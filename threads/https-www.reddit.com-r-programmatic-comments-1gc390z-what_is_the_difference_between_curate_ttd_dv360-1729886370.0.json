      "body": "Xandr Curate is an inventory packaging platform.  You can package Xandr’s inventory (or other deal ids you have through Xandr) into specific deal ids, that you then pass onto DSPs like DV360 or TTD.  Curate does no buying on its own.  It is a tool that allows you to control what requests you will see, further upstream.\n\nI assume your company wants you to use Curate because of your 1P data.  If you onboard your data to Xandr, and target those audiences in a deal, you may see higher match rates because you’re further upstream and seeing more bid requests.  A lot of decisions are made by various systems before your campaign submits a bid on a request, and you may have missed out on your particular user without knowing it.\n\nLook up 1P audience targeting through SSPs, and you’ll probably find a lot of info (and fluff lol) that explains the benefits.",
