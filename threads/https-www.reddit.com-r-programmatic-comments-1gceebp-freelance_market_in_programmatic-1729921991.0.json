      "body": "Hey there, \n\nI do something similar yet not freelance. I have launched a media trading agency. In short I create the seats for the agencies or direct clients, help the company understand what they can do with programmatic ads, deliver the campaigns, and report on them. \n\nSo I would say, yes it can be a great model, however I would advise against working with resellers and maybe try to get your own DSPs seats on Tier 2 or 3 DSPs which are still perfectly valid (in my opinion even better as they are often specialised on 1-2 formats) and run the activities from there. \n\nBarriers to start are quite brutal I have to say but once you start having a stable client base, it is, in my opinion the best side to be on in the market. You are always fully aligned with your clients and can deliver value while only doing the most fun part of the media trader role. :) \n\nHope that helps!\n\nCompany is [https://tedjordan.org](https://tedjordan.org) if some of you are wondering.",
