I've never seen a non-Amazon seller campaign perform well within their DSP. The CPM's are a bit of a black box on that DSP, and too high, comparative to other platforms, to deliver an efficient KPI.",

Or are these middle funnel tactics used to drive/retarget to the retail media channels like Amazon? You can use Amazon DSP for competitive conquesting and retarget users who’ve been to an Amazon listing of your competitor, but with your ad.  That’s one of the main appeals of Amazon DSP.",
