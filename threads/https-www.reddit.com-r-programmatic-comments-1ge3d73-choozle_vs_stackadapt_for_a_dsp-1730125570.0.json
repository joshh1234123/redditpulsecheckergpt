      "body": "I’ve used Stackadapt both in a managed service as well as self service. They’re a solid company who’s constantly innovating and adding new tools or resources to the platform. Not sure about Choozle, but Stackadapt is really easy to use, and if you come to a roadblock their reps are really helpful",

      "body": "I feel like this is my topic. Multi year Choozle user currently A:B testing the self serve options in StackAdapt. I actually came from selling Simpli.fi years ago. Choozle has grown its provider list significantly over the years. TTD, Amazon, DV360, and Xander are all at your disposal from the supply side, plus an ever growing list of measurement and planning tools. \n\nWhy A:B test other DSPs then you might ask? \n\nThe UI is pretty rough, useability is frustrating, and it seems like each new partnership they bring in they are out to monetize it, which, ok, I get it. Their default CTV PMP library is kind of mid. I've done both self serve, managed, and hybrid, and their idea of managing is essentially making sure your campaign spends 100% of its allocation, and no real performance enhancements.\n\nA lot of the reps I've seen come and go end up at StackAdapt, so I figured I'd give it a shot. So far so good. No crazy CPM differences for similar inventory and delivery. We'll see how things end up. I'm at a point in my programmatic tenure where I want my self service platforms to actually look and function well, and if I can get similar results from a platform that does just that, I figured it was worth a look.",

So if you’re going to be self-serve, then you should be quite happy there without any minimums. They can do a better job at adding more integrations, but current integrations and functionality isn’t bad at all. Staff is also helpful and usually jump on the call if campaigns are lined up.",
