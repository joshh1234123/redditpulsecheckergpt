      "body": "Congratulations on the new role! I have been in programmatic for 3 years now and still paid crappy despite independently managing nearly £1M average per quarter for the last couple quarters for this fashion retailer. \n\nI am not sure about advanced techniques but if you can take the basics and help client drive incremental value then you’ll definitely be seen as knowledgeable. For example I worked with this retailer’s in-house CDP team to help create relevant 1pa audiences, activated programmatically and talked about how this provided cross-selling value, grow LTV and also how this would help with their OKRs. For example they had lots of purchasers purchasing products from specific brands only, we targeted them to also consider other similar brands we sell. \n\nOn freelancing, I have the same questions as you but assume yes some mid to large size agencies might need help with complex builds so they could potentially reach out to someone on fiverr. \n\nFor the job hunting bit, if you keep your profile open to recruiters only on LinkedIn, I am sure you can get interviews to some high paying jobs.",
