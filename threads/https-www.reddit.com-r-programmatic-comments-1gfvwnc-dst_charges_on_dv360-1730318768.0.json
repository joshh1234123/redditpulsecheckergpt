If your current set-up automatically includes platform fees in the mediaplans, you'll have to make amendments to those templates based on the %s in the above article to ensure you stay within briefed budget. It's reportable, so would highly encourage monitoring closely once regulation goes into effect for the first couple of campaigns to ensure all goes well",
