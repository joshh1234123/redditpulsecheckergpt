But bc I didn't used to have experience on tier 1 dsps, it was really difficult to get hired at any big agencies. \n\nI heard the breakout of \"tier 1 vs tier 2\" dps while interviewing. Idk if it's very official of a \"tier list\" but it def served helpful while describing my experiences, and most I interviewed with seemed to understand it",

They cater to AdX inventory, support is nonexistent, and features are good but fall behind DV360. However, it is the DSP to use for YouTube inventory. It also allows for seamless integration with other GMP products. \n\nBoth of these DSPs offer better UI, features and scale than *most* other DSPs.

The YouTube campaigns that I've ran out of Google Ads seem perfectly fine, and if you need the CPM / YT TV inventory, use a Reservation campaign within Google ads. \n\nThere's going to be differences in price (depends on your DV360 access - direct or reseller) and some slight differences around cross-channel frequency capping, but overall Google Ads seems like a fine option for YT unless I'm missing something.",
