      "body": "They are the same. The only difference is the semantics. Media and Advertising are the same thing, just using different words.  A lot of them have cutesy names as well, like Orange Apron, Roundel, etc. Albertsons calls theirs a \"collective\" instead of network, so you could even call it an RMC.  The only major differences between them are their customers - whose 1st party data is being used for targeting.",

      "body": "First time I hear about RAN.\n\nIf we follow the same logic as Facebook vs Facebook Audience Network (FAN), I would assume:\n\nRMN: the media is owned by the retailer. Ex: Amazon\n\nRAN: the media is not owned by the retailer but Retailer's data is used for targeting. Ex: Criteo, or even Amazon's extended inventory (3rd party apps and websites)\n\nYou might face the same issues on RAN as on FAN: crappy inventory, risk of fraud, etc.",
