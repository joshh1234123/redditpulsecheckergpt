That said $2500 on the high end of that agency fee you stated is low to run ctv, audio, old campaigns which is why they prob came back and said they would have to do it higher. We keep our options open and can run small projects when we have the bandwidth. How many months are they signed for? Are these evergreen campaigns? How often do you want to swap creatives? What is the monthly ad spend? ",
