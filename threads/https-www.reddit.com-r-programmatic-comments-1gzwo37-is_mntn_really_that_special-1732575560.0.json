      "body": "Short answer— no. \n\nOne of my clients wanted me to audit their current CTV campaigns in MNTN before sending all of their business to me (primarily use TTD for CTV)\n\nSo I spent a couple hours diving into the platform. Not much more time was really needed.\n\nIts bare bones simple, and it’s clearly geared to be used in-house by a company that wants to advertise on CTV but have no marketing team. Very “point and click”, turn it on and forget it. \n\nso in that sense, it’s probably awesome and highly regarded for small businesses— those who can’t access a major DSP, can’t afford an agency, etc. \n\nBut anyone who has made a career out of programmatic will be less than thrilled with it, especially from an optimization and reporting standpoint",

The targeting is basically useless because the platform just runs on “machine learning”…my team has run multiple campaigns and you can’t optimize anything…so forget about pacing or sticking to a contracted CPM. We couldn’t get a campaign basically targeting the entire NYC DMA to deliver a consistent daily spend…I think it works for big broad advertisers who only care about branding…they really push performance…but you’re going to flood out a ton disguised display impressions to inflate your conversion window.

      "body": "NewOrleansSpeed - I'm not one to use this forum to 'pitch', but speaking up as we're very relevant to your topic of a unified platform - and perhaps we can help.  I'm with a programmatic platform that is integrated with the top 15 DSPs - simultaneously.  Meaning, a single campaign fluidly travels across all DSPs such as TTD, DV360, Yahoo, Meta, AMZN, Spotify, Vistar, and many more - while the AI optimizes in real-time, and aggregates the best performing pockets from each DSP into a single unified campaign.  We're using the strengths of many DSPs, vs just one.  Plenty of reporting and visualizations to show performance of each DSP, who's contributing, where, and how.  Nobody else is doing this.  We're outperforming the same stand-alone DSPs we're integrated with, and crushing 'Meta DSPs' and 'resellers', as they're still manual and take very high margins.\n\nDM me with any interest.  Happy to share more.",
