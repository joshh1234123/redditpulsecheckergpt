Whether or not this is possible (targeting openx ssp specifically in blis dsp) is more dependent on what the UI in blis allows and if the teams at blis and openx have created an integration between the platforms.",

In exchange you want to set a fee for whatever spend goes through that PMP deal.  \n\nI don't think you can do this with your own platform.\n\nSince you want to use deal_ids you're entering the new industry hotness.. Supply Side Curation.. so you will need to create the deal_id with the actual SSPs. \n\nOtherwise you will need to go on the old fashioned route and integrate your data on Blis and take your fee from the buyer there.\n\nIf you put your audience data in liveramp you can easily push your data to any adtech partner they have a connection with..",

If we were to move forward it would have to be through our standard deal ID activation process:\n\n(1) Confirm DSP and buying seat ID\n\n(2) OpenX builds deals based on targeting/audience parameters (e.g. site/app lists)\n\n(3) Deals sent to client for activation in the DSP, with confirmation of targeting parameters, floors, bid recommendations, etc.\n\n(4) Client to send OpenX DSP-side reporting so OpenX can assist with backend optimizations\n\nPlease let me know if this is something you’d like to move forward with.”\n\nThis is my email reply to my contact’s email above:\n\nDeals sent to client for activation in the DSP, with confirmation of targeting parameters, floors, bid recommendations, etc.\n\n“On this piece, you are just saying that we would send the deals to the client for activation on their DSP is that correct? Just want to clarify. \n\nSo basically what you are saying above is that we can’t add in a percentage for our fees directly embedded in Deals & Deal IDs that OpenX creates; and that OpenX will not do direct payouts to us is that correct? \n\nIn this scenario, how can we charge for our services then if OpenX can not do payouts? How do other 3rd Party providers have this setup with OpenX in similar situations?”",
