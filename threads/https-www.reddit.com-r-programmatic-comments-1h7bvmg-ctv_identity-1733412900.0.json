      "body": "IMO, TTD wins by a long shot.  First, almost every major CTV publisher now passes UIDs.  In addition, it seems like many of these publishers are even creating direct connections to TTD, resulting in less hops and more direct signals.\n\nTheir graph is made up of multiple graphs including their own, live ramp and one other company.   This allows them to map to more IDs and doesn’t limit them to only google or yahoo logins.",

But, they’re all going to be limited to their view of the universe. Hence why it’s best to go with publisher agnostic solutions with scale. \n\nLiveramp identity solutions trace users for 50ish years. They’re built on old Acxiom tech that was built for direct mail and then connected to online identifiers. Why are they best in the identity game? They start with offline data, and then extend online. \n\nIn general though, CTV identity is a mess because a TV is a shared device by nature. It’s a household level device, not individual. With restrictions on content signals, it’s impossible to understand who’s watching.\n\nIn the future, when TTD releases their OS, we shall what that does to it. It may include user initiated sessions (if they’re smart), where individual watchers have a profile with a UID2 (hashed email).",
