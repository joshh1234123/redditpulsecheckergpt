      "body": "Most of our success has come from using OTT as an upper funnel “branding” or awareness tactic. \n\nWe measure site visits from these viewers, build LAL modeled audiences and retarget them across the slate of platforms. These audiences drive better conversion performance, than almost any other upper funnel tactic we have used so far.\n\nAmazon OTT is best if you’re an endemic seller, but the strategy can be replicated on TTD, DV or any other capable DSP",

But another way is second screen retargeting. Reaching this same user first on their CTV/OTT channel, then reaching them again using a mid to lower funnel tactic like display or rich media. This touches all parts of the funnel.",

      "body": "I've been scaling OTT/CTV budgets with ecomm brands for a bit. A few key tips. Supply path matters, this will keep costs in check while also getting you higher-quality traffic. Numbers on paper are a guide but not truth. In-platform metrics are helpful to optimize the channel but you need MMM, geo studies etc. to tell the whole story and prove the value of the channel. Don't lean into just a single mode of transacting. For most brands, you will see the best results with a mix of PG and PMP (biddable) tactics. If you go down this path that will narrow the field on DSP choices that make sense as you should execute and measure both buy types side by side.\n\nGood Luck!",

It's also a large part of ALL our strategies, no matter the KPI, to retarget all OTT & audio viewers with clickable video and display. This helps grow frequency at a fraction of the cost, after knowing the OTT ad made an impact with sight/sound/emotion. Plus gives the consumer something to click on.\n\n1st party data is always gold...and I will also add we've grown our direct partnerships with 2nd party data sources QUITE a bit, which has helped us see better results with both CPG & ecomm overall. 2nd party data is much cleaner compared to 3rd party...think Whole Foods purchase data on Amazon, Home Depot/Lowes/Dollar General on TTD, etc.",
