Overall nice to have worked it out, but it was a pain.\n\nGeneral thoughts - We've booked traditionally on DOOH for about 20 years. Overall sentiment from my team is.. very underwhelmed. Scrappy budgets from traditionally big spenders, really challenging to service a client, risky with any category exclusive buys we might have on the go, the algorithms as to when and where an ad is served is wild. We had a client recently getting most of their plays at 2am-4am for a generic whiteware brand.\n\nIt's early days - we'll see what 2025 brings. But I would worry if we were operating on tight margins as it feels like it has the potential to send a few owners out of business.",

I wasn't sure how much of an issue that would be moving forward, but having spoke with reps from a few SSPs now, I'm realizing that we're in pretty good shape. \n\nIt's both a blessing and a curse that we are a tech company who accidentally developed an advertising platform. It means we have a lot of development resources, but we didn't know this was going to be the market our product ended up servicing when we started. That left a lot of unknowns for us.",
