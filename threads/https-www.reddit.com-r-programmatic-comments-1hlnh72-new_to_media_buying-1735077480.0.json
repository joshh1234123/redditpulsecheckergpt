Work directly with clients/agencies, work on RFPs, etc. Could be managed service or self serve clients depending on spend.\n\nLots of options man. Take a look at the Trade Desk for large agency type customers, the likes of stackadapt and quantcast are good options too for more mid size agencies.",

As the client, if I ask any semi-technical questions and get crickets, I immediately lose faith in you and then your company by proxy. You don’t have to be the ops expert, but know your product/service, know about the industry, know about how you compare to competitors.",

If you’re on the sales side, the first thing I would do is get familiar with the main DSPs that agencies use which are DV360 and Trade Desk. If you work at a company that is its own DSP and a smaller DSP at that, it will be a lot harder for you to get sales but not impossible, you’ll just have to reach out to smaller or independent agencies or in house brands ",
