      "body": "It would depend on how you intend to use that data and the geographic location / regulation but assuming you want to somehow enable advertisers to use it in programmatic since you post here I would recommend you look into frameworks such as the IAB Transparency and Consent Framework as a start if it relates to Europe which has very strict privacy regulation. TCF passes consent information from users into the bid stream so for example a DSP can see if a user has opted in to them using the data as a vendor. Note that not all TCF vendors need to be approved. https://iabeurope.eu/tcf-for-publishers/\n\nI’d also look into for example ID5 since universal IDs are important for tech vendors ability to match IDs and enriching data, these IDs are available in the bidstream to target. https://id5.io/",
