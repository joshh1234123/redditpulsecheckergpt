There is a great book called The Death of Demographics and it speaks to the moving trend that people buy because of value not because of a demographic match. Butter is something that pretty much every one will buy so you'll definitely want to have a top of the funnel approach. Mass reach is key. CTV and streaming radio should be considerations. At our DSP, we do a lot of geofencing so I would geofence grocery stores and farmers markets. DM me if you want to chat.",

Going after recent butter purchasers probably won’t cut it via like a circana but you be surprised how much difference having the right data partners will do for you.\n\nHow are you measuring sales? CPG data attribution ? Ie working with Kroger to see purchasing data. Assuming you are using a full funnel approach?\n\nIf you like to chat further send me a dm. Or we can chat here.",

If there is a strong social media presence, running social programmatic ads would help to drive home the social acceptance of the brand. We use Spaceback all the time with a lot of success.",

      "body": "Footfall attribution can be tricky because thanks to Apple you are only hitting about 50% and who’s to say they are there to buy the butter. Do you have a landing page set up specific to the campaign. Say a store location ad” find butter here” as a great retargeting tool. A lot of awareness tactics really boil down to intent and showing that. \n\nFor example if you want to sell a premium product go after that premium Audience that can afford or see the benefits of buying this specific butter over the cheaper alternatives. \n\nIE. health intenders, going after people that have a calorie counting app installed on their phone etc. \n\nSo a lot of your creatives will fall under that educational type content. Our team works with 100s of CPG brands and have these conversations all the time. \n\nSent you a dm. But this stuff fascinates me. Happy to chat some more there. Can’t give all the juice to the World Wide Web 😂",
