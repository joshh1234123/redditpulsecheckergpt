Depending on the formats you need, some smaller DSPs might be better though. \n\nIn which geo are you operating?

I know Adform has separate client accounts where you can keep campaigns, line items, and billing separate.

Adform is the opposite, full transparent and all fees disclosed. \n\nI look after New business for Adform Uk so can point you to the right direction. \n\nAll Geos are serviced and easy reporting that can go really deep (log level data)  or you want to pipe it out via api to your chosen dashboarding tools if your agency workflows need it. \n\nThose minimums are roughly correct  mentioned earlier in the thread. \n\nConfirm also Adform’s platform hierarchy is pretty flexible and can cater for this requirement and user roles and permissions will allow for you to keep your agency client teams and projects separated.
