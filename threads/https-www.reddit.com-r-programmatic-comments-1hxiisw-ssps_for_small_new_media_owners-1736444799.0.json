This is why I’m just at the research stage.\n\nThe screens would be in indoor community sports venues, like ice rinks.\n\nI wouldn’t expect SSPs to work with me either so few screens. I’m trying to gauge how many I would need before they would.\n\nWhat would be the minimum? 25? 100?",

You would also need some 3rd party measurments to validate the impression count before you could be on-boarded to an SSP. Good luck with your new venture.",
