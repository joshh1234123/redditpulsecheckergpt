      "body": "You answered your own question correctly, your programmatic team is lazy. Unfortunately that is common in some agencies. They should look beyond just the basic tools available in their DSP (which I assume follows the same laziness in picking and probably just one platform as well in classic fashion). \n\nThere are lot of good video inventory out there. Not least if you use the right ad formats. Dig into the more sophisticated ad formats out there. Some vendors focus on this alone and there are great outstream formats.\n\nI don’t have any affiliation with Teads and I don’t work there but they can show as an example of what an outstream format can look like in quality inventory. Check their inread video examples out: https://www.teads.com/publishers-showcase/\n\nSo focus on inventory (PMPs, quality etc) and ad formats (including ones not built into the DSP by default).",

That's the start I'd recommend to control the risks (many risks).\n\nOnce you get the PMP up and running, then you can start exploring the darkness of the Open Marketplace, especially for Video.\n\nYou should know that IAB Tech Lab clarified what's In-stream and what's not (there's no out-stream anymore). Your first question should be about the respect of those specs, be it by DSP, SSP, or publisher (or even you, agency, when it comes to transparency with advertisers)",

      "body": "Online Video is cheaper and can drive site traffic... unlike CTV so for video buys it is a good inclusion as it reduces overall CPMs and it does lead to site visits. \n\nYou can layer on data partners or buy PMPs to help with placement and audience. If you have a CRM list you can upload that through LiveRamp and target the audience. You can even take it a step further and do a look-a-like audience off of the CRM list.\n\nI do work for a DSP and have had a lot of success with Online Video as well as CTV. We do a lot of addressable targeting through our platform that helps to hone in on the right audience.\n\nMaybe your programmatic team is not diving deep enough?? Not sure but there are a lot of great use cases and successes that can be accomplished using Online Video",

      "body": "Online video can be great for the reasons you stated but desktop online video can be so full of crap! Half the time you get these small players on the bottom right hand of the screen that is barely noticeable and often playing within other \"content\" completely unrelated to the content on the page that the viewer came for so it can be targeted as \"full episode in-streaming\" content!! Amazon DSP used to let you pick between out stream or full episode players but it's was a mute point anyway because of that fact so they actually got rid of it and you can no longer target by type of player. If it's true in-stream video it can be great or out stream video that plays right within the feed you are scrolling but those small players on the bottom right hand of desktop screens are a complete waste of money!!!",

      "body": "Your hesitance is warranted, you need to be very careful otherwise you will just burn $$. Buying from PMPs is a good recommendation but you have to specifically ask for the lower quality player types, sizes, domains & apps to be removed from the pmps. & then your programmatic team has to actually check after the fact to verify what's coming through the pmps and what youre buying. If your cpms are in the single digits you are burning cash. Don't be surprised to pay high teens to low twenties for high quality placements that people actually can see. It requires some extra attention but you can manage. Good Luck OP",

Curation can kill scale and sometimes roas so I am not 100% convinced on this new buzz word/trend but I do agree with most on this thread that there is a ton of bad supply in the OLV space. Look at your KPIs and begin to ask what they recommend to optimize towards and start to trim the poor performing audience segments, geos, pubs, devices, creatives…. Best approach is always a data driven one. Sometime open OLV delivers amazing results for advertisers. Sometimes it doesn’t. Read the data and react accordingly",
