Out of curiosity since it seems you might know ....do you know how this ID-level coordination achieved by SSPs?\n\n(ie. how do the individual SSPs, who ostensibly operate as individual businesses with limited system inter-mingling, organize on a regular basis to ensure they always assign the same ID to the same business entity?)\n\nIs there some sort of SSP standardizing organization like the IAB that provides a shared framework?\n\nDo the DSPs create and issue the IDs so they act like this standardizing entity? (for example ive heard of DV360 \"issuing SeatIDs\" for new advertisers in the past/until recently ...but im not sure if they used to do so in their capacity as a DSP, as an Exchange, as an adserver or what lol",
