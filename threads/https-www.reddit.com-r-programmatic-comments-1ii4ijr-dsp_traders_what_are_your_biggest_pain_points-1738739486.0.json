We once did a transparency analysis for a large advertisers partnering with our preferred DSP, SSP and a limited number of publishers. Even when full understanding of the fees taken by all parties you can't match every dollar across the ecosystem, which for an industry as large as ad-tech/programmatic should be unacceptable like in any other industry. However, in programmatic we all just kinda accept these things which is bonkers.\n\nThat being said, I think the level of transparency with managed service will always be even worse and with that you also lose a lot of control to even do these types of analyses so DSPs at least have that as a +1",

Pretty simplistic UI that's relatively easy to learn. It was my first DSP.\n\nTTD cannot access YouTube inventory or those free Google audiences. It's also incredibly manual, where every feature has an associated cost. You can do just about anything on TTD, but you'd be better served by already having DSP knowledge before you spin up a campaign there. TTD is incredibly neutral in terms of attribution credit. Google tends to put its thumb on lots of scales considering how much of the programmatic landscape they own.\n\nTTD also goes through more major changes than DV360, in my experience. I've had to learn and relearn how to use TTD three times since I started using it in 2021. From legacy to Solimar to Kokai.",
