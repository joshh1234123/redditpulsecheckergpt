      "body": "The majority of programmatic display clicks are erroneous/accidental.\n\nIt'll never attribute properly or even close in GA4 when comparing DV360 clicks.\n\nWhile your particular mismatch is pretty far off, it isn't totally unheard of.\n\nI'd have your vendor (Agency with a direct DV360 instance from the sound of it) exclude all app inventory and optimize for a KPI that isn't a click.\n\nYou see a mismatch on TTD as well, albeit, not usually this bad.\n\nYou could could have a tagging issue but more likely it's crummy inventory and ththe clicks you think you're getting aren't users intending to get to the site.\n\nAccidental/erroneous (not fraudulent, usually, but sometimes) are a lot more common than real clicks most of the time.\n\nThe majority of users will come through organic, direct and paid search for actual display users.\n\nCTV is even worse because there's nothing to click, if running in combination with display, it's going to be 99.9% display driving activity in GA4 when it happens.\n\nI'd wager your placement and publishers are low CPM meh sites.\n\nBottomline is if you're trying to use GA4 as any kind of source of truth for DV360 or any other programmatic campaign, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nYour vendor should be assisting in education here rather than letting you spin your wheels as a tagging issue.\n\nThat being said, if it is a lot of YouTube traffic it may be an error but it sounds like you noticed cpc in was getting most of the credit so I assumed it was a seperate thing.",

      "body": "DV360 and YouTube attribution issues in GA4 are a common frustration, so you're definitely not alone.\n\nIt's especially confusing when other channels like Meta seem to work fine.\n\nThe problem you're seeing, where DV360 traffic is misattributed to Google CPC or showing large discrepancies, is a known issue that can stem from a few different factors, often related to how Google's different platforms talk to each other.\n\nThe core of the problem often lies in the interaction between DV360's tracking and GA4's default auto-tagging.\n\nWhile the GA4 property is linked to your DV360 advertiser, a DV360 auto-tagging parameter called `dclid` is added to your URLs.\n\nThis is meant to help GA4 attribute traffic correctly, but sometimes it can conflict with your UTM parameters or GA4's own logic, causing the traffic to be incorrectly categorized as `google / cpc`.\n\nThis can be compounded by differences in how each platform counts sessions and clicks.\n\nFor example, DV360 counts a \"click\" when a user interacts with an ad, but GA4 only counts a \"session\" when the landing page loads successfully.\n\nAdd in factors like ad blockers, quick-bouncing users, and network latency, and that discrepancy can become massive.\n\nA key part of troubleshooting this is making sure your account linking and attribution settings are configured correctly.\n\nFirst, ensure your GA4 property is properly linked to your DV360 advertiser, and that auto-tagging is enabled in the link settings.\n\nThis link is the most reliable way to pass campaign data between the two platforms.\n\nSecond, review your GA4 attribution settings.\n\nWhile Data-Driven Attribution is a powerful model, it requires a significant amount of data to work effectively.\n\nIf your conversion volume is low, it might be defaulting to a different model or struggling to accurately credit the right touchpoints.\n\nYou might consider temporarily testing a different attribution model, like `Google paid channels last click`, to see if it helps clarify the reporting.\n\nThird, check your manual UTM tags.\n\nEven with auto-tagging, it's possible for manual tags to conflict or be incomplete.\n\nFor YouTube, you should be linking your YouTube channel to DV360 as well, as this helps with video-specific metrics.\n\nFinally, because this issue is often platform-wide, be prepared for some level of discrepancy.\n\nProgrammatic display and OTT campaigns will almost never have a perfect 1:1 match with sessions and conversions in GA4.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the gap and ensure the data is directionally accurate.\n\nIf you've done all of the above, it might be a good idea to create a custom report in the GA4 Explore section, as it allows you to use dimensions like `Session manual source / medium` which can sometimes show the correct UTM values even when the default traffic reports don't.",
