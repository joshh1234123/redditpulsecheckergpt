Google to Google, not Google to other 3P sources), and typically in only one direction (eg. capping exposed YouTube users on other channels, but not vice versa), effectively preferencing YouTube over 3P sources.\n\nConsolidated reporting and campaign management are benefits too, to an extent.",

Face value this makes sense but in reality we just know what the fees actually are instead of it being entirely opaque on google ads. This is one of the biggest reasons that very large clients and large agencies buy ads on DV360 vs. Google ads- because if we know exactly what percentage Google is charging, and we can negotiate around that we can produce much lower CPMs inventory than on Google ads. People will probably downvote this into the ground, but it’s how the industry actually works.",

That Floodlight, especially if its come from CM360, has visibility of tagged channels beyond just itself, which is somewhat more useful than Google Ads Conversion Tags, where it only sees itself. Only workaround is if you pushed GA4 events in & use that for bidding.\n\nThough is that worth the 4% on average fee, probably not.",
