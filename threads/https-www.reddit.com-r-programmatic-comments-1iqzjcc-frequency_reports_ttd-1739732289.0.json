Versus just a general “average reach and frequency”\n\n2) by extension - an analysis that compares your key KPI’s i.e. total conversions or conversion rates at each of these above frequency buckets. Helps you answer the question “we should try to reach people X amount of times, and frequency cap at X+Y ad exposures”",

      "body": "What were the KPIs? Were they looking for R/F? Or did they have a lower funnel KPI to complement here? \n\nFrequency can be subjective to the ultimate goal, high frequency may mean low reach and vice versa. Did they want as many people as possible to be exposed or did they want to drive home the messaging? Or both?\n\nIf the goal was conversions, did they provide the average frequency for those who converted? So you can highlight strong performance and provide insights into future campaign best practices. \n\nMaybe ask your rep if they have any insights into frequency goals per vertical or KPI tactic and see how this campaign compared. \n\nJust my thoughts, really comes down to what the KPI was, and what role frequency played in it.",

      "body": "Well one very interesting report my client love is the media mix report where they are able to see how CTV along with web channel influenced the conversion uplift. Not sure if that report is available on TTD though. \nProbably try compare your YOY traffic uplift since the campaign went live. If they did not run any campaign last Jan you can try and make a story around your campaigns influence in the increase in traffic. Qhich Adserver are you using?",

You can analyse conversion & reach data of households that were exposed to *one* channel vs households that were exposed to both CTV *and* a channel within that 10% of activity to see how conversion behaviour changes. \n\nLike the original comment said though, you'll need TTD to help you with this as even if you're ingesting log level data it requires joining TTD's cross device graph.",
