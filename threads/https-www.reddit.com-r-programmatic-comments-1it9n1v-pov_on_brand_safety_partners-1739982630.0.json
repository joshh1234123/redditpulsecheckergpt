      "body": "One solution is post-bid (observing/blocking impressions based on viewability, brand safety and fraud). The platform off the shelf option is pre-bid (based on DV/IAS previously observed environments, avoiding bidding on it at all).\n\nEither solutions are black box, limited in their technological capabilities, and highly criticized in their coverage and actual capacity in catching bad actors (re: recent Adalytics CSAM report) .\n\nI would recommend running ads solely on vetted inclusion lists of sites and apps , or 1:1 with renown publishers (through programmatic deals) where real humans consume media within your advertisers' market. With that, you should never have to pay (read: waste) money for 3rd party verification partners.",

      "body": "I'm going to say it depends on you/the clients level of concern and the balance of brand safety to other KPIs. \n\nThe third party vendors tend to be more robust and have more options and best to align with their methodology if the campaign has any measurement with them.\n\nIf brand safety is a bit of a 'box tick' to scrub the worst content any DSP features are going to be sufficient.\n\nIt also depends what your buying and how granular you might be concerned, for example a vetted site list can help but is your client going to care about specific articles in that site?\n\nAre you trying to scale up or test an audience data, maybe you need the extra reach without an inclusion list so you want some extra safety options to help scrub bad content.",

      "body": "As others have rightfully pointed out, it depends a bit on what your client is after. Is it a blanket approach we just need some level of brand safety in place, but will not waste time validating by looking at log-files? Then any platform off-the-shelf option that's free should suffice. Especially when paired with curated inventory strategies.\n\nIf your client is very worried about appearing in certain contexts, i.e., a finance advertiser being especially worried around any negative news to-do with the financial industry and certain other topics then you're better of leveraging some more nuanced sentiment enabled segments from a Peer 39, IAS or DV",
