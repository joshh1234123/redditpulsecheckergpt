There's a lot you can do with log-level data to understand audience behaviour and patterns on content consumption and how it relates to potential outcomes. Combine this with ML & you could start looking at more advanced curation of your supply, the contexts you are buying for certain audiences and potential creative variations. Yes basic reporting can do some of these things, but nowhere near the level of granularity of log-files.",
