TTD fees are normally a bit higher than DV3.\n\nManaged services vary but you should be able to find something around 15-20% from an established shop. For smaller clients / campaigns most agencies arbitrage on the hourly rate they pay for managed services and what they charge clients (%age of media managed).",
