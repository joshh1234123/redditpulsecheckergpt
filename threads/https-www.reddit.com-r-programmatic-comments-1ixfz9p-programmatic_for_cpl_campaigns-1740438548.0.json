So if you've maxed out leads or otherwise seeing diminishing returns DSP buy could do the dual purpose of branding and CPL. \n\nDepending on what your promoting audience and/or contextual targets could find new leads. \n\nRemarketing also through display ads can help also, reminding users who visited the site but did not fill out the form (make sure you have an exclusion audience for completions also) which would typically perform better than broad targets.\n\nLookalike audiences also can be another DSP tactic.\n\nRemarketing might be cheaper with a 'native' provider like Taboola though rather than an enterprise DSP.",
