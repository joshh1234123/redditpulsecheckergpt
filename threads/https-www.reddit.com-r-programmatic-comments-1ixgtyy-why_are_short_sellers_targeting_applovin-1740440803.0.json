      "body": "Applovin is overvalued - it's that simple. A 30x revenue multiple is extremely high, especially for a company that's transitioning into a \"pure advertising platform\".\n\nYes, their financial growth looks strong, but a lot of that growth was fueled by expanding beyond gaming advertisers into e-commerce and finance brands. But there are still hurdles with mobile gaming inventory—brand safety, fraud, and attribution concerns make many advertisers hesitant to invest.\n\nOn top of that, competition is fierce. If mobile gaming ad spend truly scales, Google, Amazon, and The Trade Desk won’t just sit back and watch—they’ll adjust their offerings to stay competitive, just like they did with CTV. Not sure if their moat in the mobile gaming space is strong enough.\n\nFuture short seller triggers: Advertiser demand slows on mobile gaming ads, bigger DSP aggressively moves into mobile gaming, or some sort of Adalytics audit that uncovers ad fraud or brand safety flags (PR nightmare).\n\nAlso, it's probably part of the wider trend of overhyped tech stocks getting hammered lately.",

It takes a lot for an app developer to make the switch.\n\nAlso building a mediation platform is very difficult and costs a ton of resources to maintain. Google has had a mediation platform for over a decade (AdMob) which, despite a lot of investment, still really doesn’t hold a candle to Applovin, Unity, or Digital Turbine.  google has been aggressively offering guarantees for pubs to switch and still they platform is only marginally growing year to year.  \n\nThe number 2 platform in the industry is Unity, which is currently poised to absorb most of applovin’s customers if whatever this fraud allegation is causes their pubs to leave the platform.  TTD might be the most interesting option to drink applovin’s milkshake - but they’ve yet to build any true mobile-first supply side product - so i can’t see any apps rushing to put their ad business in their hands.",

Yes, Facebook’s service update in 2015 crippled Zynga’s user base - but applovin is a completely different business model than Zynga.  Zynga at no point was ever an ad tech company.\n\nFurther - Meta has already made it abundantly clear they don’t want to be a platform, and are content with FAN being an ad network that extends the reach from their o&o inventory to the supply in their network.  As i mentioned in another comment - google has been trying to disrupt applovin’s (and previously mopubs) business for over a decade, but the admob platform is just too inferior to the incumbants in the space, and even google doesnt have the stomach to hit the reset button and throw millions of dollars at building a new one",
