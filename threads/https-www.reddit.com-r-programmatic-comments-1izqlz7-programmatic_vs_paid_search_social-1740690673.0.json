      "body": "That sounds odd you have not operated in any DSP yet. A few things here:\n\n\\- You can look for an actual programmatic role, but another angle on this is stay for a bit longer (or no harm if you don't land a new/better role right away) and use that \"experience\" (the time) as leverage to maybe lateral or move one step up. You will finally get good experience, but also easier to get that job\n\n\\- There are roles that may entail of a few disciplines, but programmatic is one of the more robust/difficult ones to understand and become an expert in (maybe some aspects of search). You can do a couple good years of programmatic and move into a more general digital space. However, programmatic you operate in an open internet across many channels within. Lots of flack everywhere, but especially those walled gardens (Meta, etc.) you would be more tied to. People on the social/search side pretend they can just easily move into programmatic and that programmatic isn't transferrable (maybe more to social) to their channel. I have seen more people try to switch to programmatic from social and it is a bigger flop since somehow programmatic people are understanding of certain transferrable skills even though not to the extent to get into programmatic (just from my observation).\n\n\\- If you know people or can volunteer at a capacity to do some other social/digital work to slowly up your skills in that over time in order to switch or even see if it is something you actually like. \n\n\\- Keep working on those certifications\n\n\\- I don't want to sound annoying if this has been tried or a dynamic with your boss/team that I may not know of, but hopefully you have asked/brought up your desire (practically a need) to do some actual work. Even if it is a thing they show you, then you do in front of them. Sometimes there really is not the most work to go around in certain accounts, but if you have a decent rapport with your manager and they aren't the worst person on earth (though they may not be good at managing from the sound of it), it at least shows you tried. You can sleep knowing you put your best foot forward and if it is a no from them, then you showed their true colors and you can move on emotionally/physically.\n\nHopefully this makes sense. Overall, sticking with programmatic is great. Best of luck.",

      "body": "I was in the similar situation. My first jobs was also at a big company, doing data entry. Even though your doing data entry, you're doing something related to programmatic, so all you got to do is try to understand all the things that you do at atleast theoretically.\n\nFor taxonomy: understand what are all the words that they use in a target/placement.\nbrunello-pg_gumgum_hosted-15seconds-video-italy\ntake the above for example. and simply ask chatgpt: my company is running a campaign with this placement name, help me understand it with breakdown.\nSo next time when a similar placement comes in all you gota recognise is\n\nbrunello - is a clothing brand, we're running campaign for.\npg - is the type of inventory we're running the campaign.\ngumgum - is the inventory partner that's giving us the supply.\nhosted - you give your ad tags to gumgum, and they'll deliver it from their end.\n15sec video - is the type of ad we're using for this target.\nitaly - is the country we specifically running this campaign.\n\nFor QA process the same, ask chatgpt every field that you QA. just understand what that field is used for.\n\nSo basically start with the understanding the basic things, don't wait for anybody to teach you. This is everything that you gota do to get to next level.\n\nAfter this when you interview for other other companies, all they are going to ask you is if you understand the basic concepts in programmatic. Atleast if you have an idea of it.\n\nProgrammatic is intresting when you see the flow of impressions - what happens before/during/after with inpressions. Just by understanding things alone you'll easily be at the top 20%. and you'll be a huge demand either agency/ in house.\n\nUnlike social/search programmatic is not easy to learn, so feel fortunate & fully utilize the access you've got now with programmatic.\n\nHappy journey!",

      "body": "Agree with the above. \n\nPaid search is going through a \\*major\\* transformation given the rise of Ai. Programmatic ads (retail, online video and CTV) are the big opportunities moving forward IMO. Social is where the bulk of ad dollars are flowing but difficult to crack that nut with less than a year experience.\n\nI haven't put hands on keyboard/UI in years but I can see how that is appealing for someone getting into the industry. That said, 10 months is not long. Commend your \"go get it\" attitude but I'd cross the 1-year mark and ideally, bring up your desire to be a programmatic trader in an annual review. \n\nIn the meantime, I would go through the free trainings available from major DSPs. Taking the time to do this is a signal to your current employer that you are committed. Not as sexy as flighting campaigns but still valuable as you build your experience/CV. There are a lot of folks who would be thrilled to work at one of the major agencies, be grateful for where you are and keep learning - perseverance pays!",
