And if pixels are an issue then use something like intent IQ or any 1st party data attribution partner to prove lift from CTV. Because google is going to take a lot of the credit so having the right attribution partner is key here. Send me a dm happy to chat shop and give more 🍵",

However, if you're an e-com brand with an Amazon store I'd use the Amazon DSP if you can even though it's the clunkiest of all DSPs. It will just make the measurement of success for that part of your business so much more successful",
