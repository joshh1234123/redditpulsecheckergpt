The potential increase in cost could be worth the trade off as the big screen drives better ad recall.\n\nBut it’s important to accept that many/most people will skip as soon as they can and to avoid wastage your creative should be optimised with the key message understandable in the initial seconds.",

      "body": "What's your creative length? Besides looking at VCR by device, I'd also encourage you to look at placement reports and what is driving up VCR. In my experience, most placements that drive high VCR are music videos and similar long-form music content, that's likely playing in the background. If that's the case you should ask yourself whether your creative actually \"works\" in that context, or you're better of paying for lower VCRs but a more engaged audience",
