      "body": "I mean dynamic creative optimization is a big market right now. Most publishers are switching to some sort of tag based delivery method for demand because of the variability.\n\nHaving a good offering for the the demand side or creative side to have alternate creatives based on time of day, location, weather etc are big wins in todays market. \n\nThere are a lot of places to make impacts, you just need resources, build something solid and get a client. Then you can build off of that. Prob a good local market so you don’t have to worry about scaling concerns in other server regions as well.",

      "body": "I’m confused. Love to get some clarification here regarding DCO. Is part of it generating creatives by leveraging generative AI to improve the ad’s performance based on a set of KPIs? If that’s the case, won’t the creatives be showcasing products that don’t look like the real advertised products to a degree? I mean, if it’s AI generated, how would it match the actual advertised products?",

      "body": "Really inspiring to see someone from a non-technical background diving into Python and MySQL. That initiative will definitely pay off, especially in AdTech. Jivox and Viant both bring strong USPs, but there’s definitely still a gap when it comes to customization and flexibility for mid-sized brands or agencies. ACR in bid signaling is a smart angle, not many are tackling that space in a transparent, scalable way yet.\n\nIf you're thinking of building your own product, it might be worth exploring custom adtech solutions https://attekmi.com/custom-adtech-development-services early on. I’ve seen some founders go that route to build tailored solutions faster without having to piece together generic tools. Could be a great way to prototype something around dynamic creatives or contextual CTV targeting before fully scaling.",

Tag-based delivery makes sense as publishers optimize for efficiency and variability in demand.\n\nI completely agree that having a strong offering, whether on the demand side or creative side, can drive significant impact. Time-based, geo-targeted, and weather-adaptive creatives are powerful levers for engagement and conversion.\n\nPublisher specific products are getting overcrowded and dominated by some big players such as Magnite, Pubmatic, Triplelifft.",

It is there and pretty effective at what it does (identifying programming on glass) - the hard part in my experience is getting pubs to play ball passing these signals programmatically so anyone can transact at the level that is useful. It’s not a tech issue, it’s a prisoner’s dilemma which I don’t see changing any time soon",

      "body": "I believe, below are the points which can be leveraged to utilise ACR and motivate publishers to do so\n\n1.\t⁠Privacy-Preserving Data Collaboration \n\n- Use clean rooms or encrypted data exchanges where publishers can share ACR data without exposing raw logs. \n- Platforms like LiveRamp, InfoSum, or Google PAIR could facilitate privacy-safe sharing while still allowing advertisers to optimize targeting.\n\n2.\t⁠Closed Network or Consortium Approach \n\n- Form a publisher coalition where members agree to pool and monetize ACR data collectively.\n- This reduces competitive risk and provides greater leverage against walled gardens (Google, Amazon, Meta).\n\n3.\t⁠Incentivized Signal Sharing \n\n- Offer tiered monetization models where publishers get better revenue share or CPMs for sharing more granular signals. \n- Example: A bidding premium for publishers that pass ACR signals, incentivizing gradual adoption.",

      "body": "Hi, I work in a DCO adtech as an account manager. Great question indeed as OP mentioned.  \n  \nDCO does indeed optimize existing assets by dynamically changing the elements within the asset (the image, the text, the CTA, the colours, etc.) based on specific criteria and data in order to show the most relevant ad to the user.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, one of my clients is an airline company. They have over 200 destinations and our job is to dynamize the ad so it fits the user that it is being shown to. The ad contains multiple origins and destinations, the price of the tickets, other texts and a CTA. All of these elements are dynamic. So let's say user A is located in Paris and we know this thanks to his IP address. We can use this to make it so the departure city is Paris. So we would have Paris-Amsterdam, Paris-Milan, Paris-Rome (the destinations are chosen at random). Then, via an API connection to the client's database, we know the price for each ticket in real time and we can show that in the creative.\n\nIt's important to note that DCO does not need to always show products. One of our clients used DCO with geolocation and weather data to show different landscapes (snow, beach, mountain, etc). The images used for this campaign were AI generated :)",
