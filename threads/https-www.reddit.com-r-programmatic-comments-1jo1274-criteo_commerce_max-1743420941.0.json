Whatever you do, don't let criteo run off-site campaigns managed service as you'll pay a hefty managed service fee for them to buy the crappiest of long-tail inventory",

      "body": "So based on my experience on the agency side, it sounded like Criteo partners with the different retailers and for some they're allowed to use it for off-site in their self-serve platform and with others only for managed service. No clue why this is/was the case, but that's what was communicated to us.\n\nThe off-site product, basically then just used their retailer data to target these identified as in-market users against what I can only presum was the bidswitch SSP supply. Based on campaigns I ran and reports received, the quality of what you buy isn't great (verified using 3rd party and human checks) and there was no solid attribution model proving incrementally. Based on this we saw no proof running these strategies drove incremental value, outside of the BAU programmatic activity, so we stopped running it",
