      "body": "I run a startup agency that uses The Trade Desk (TTD) as our primary DSP, and here’s a quick summary of my experience so far:\n\nDemand for advertising and marketing consulting is still strong – especially among SMBs who are trying to navigate an increasingly complex landscape.\n\nProgrammatic is a tough sell. Most SMBs and even larger companies in my market (Norway) are hesitant to move away from direct deals with publishers – which honestly still baffles me.\n\nMost of our clients need to be “warmed up” through channels like Google Ads, Meta, and other walled gardens. Once they see solid results there, I use that momentum to explain how Programmatic works – including the use of first-party and third-party data for targeting.\n\nI’ve been in the game since 2020, and the COVID years were actually some of the best for Programmatic in Norway.\n\nI launched my own agency in March 2024. Since then, I’ve tripled the number of clients for other services – but our core Trade Desk client group has stayed relatively small (though loyal).\n\nEvery single client has come through referrals. I’ve considered hiring salespeople, but haven’t needed them so far thanks to strong word of mouth.\n\nTalent is extremely hard to find. Most skilled professionals are tied up in the larger agencies. We’ve hired our own headhunter to track down people, but none have had formal Programmatic training. Most of the promising hires have been former interns.",

      "body": "Got first-hand experience of it here for many years going back to before the age when Google made YT inventory available only in DBM and got exclusive deals with major holding companies etc. Including building our own tech to some extent. I'd say the programmatic agency side has changed quite a bit. Back in the early days the larger agencies including holding companies were more open to partner with other smaller agencies, this has changed and that opportunity I would say is more difficult today. Meta and Google as you know dominate the digital ad market across agencies, advertisers (small and large). So you'll see a lot of advertisers pick their agencies based on those skills (plus SEO, marketing automation, content/creative). Focusing on programmatic only will put you in a position where you will normally have customers that either have an additional agency for paid search/social or do it in-house. So you can expect to have customer relationships where you are very specialized. And then you can of course add to it then that those agencies who specialize in search/social could add in some programmatic to their offering as well. \n\n  \nMy recommendation would be to specialize in a vertical. Go very deep into a specific sector (and combine with a geographic area). You could for example be incredibly specialized in e-commerce, gaming, fashion, pharma or any other vertical. Then become really really good at that one. There is a good say from Michael Porters classic books on strategy which (very simplified) says you can either be cheaper (which is difficult), or you can be different / better. So I would say go for different / better and to be that these days you need to specialize in something. If you want to go into multiple industries / sectors then maybe you should have multiple agencies.",

It’s a networking game for sure and customer service matters more than anything.  \n\nManage pricing by understanding how much you need to pocket and how much you need to put in market to perform. \n\nJust depends on what your aspirations are. If you want to bill a couple hundred million that’ll be tough to compete. If you’re happy with a few clients getting you $3-10 mil then it’s definitely doable.",

      "body": "Norway is a tiny market (with all due respect). I had clients there that were managed by teams located in Stockholm, Berlin, or London (or even Poland).\n\n\nI believe your growth comes from prospects that were managed from outside Norway. Because you're a local agency, that works in your favour. Eastern Europe has had a similar pattern. The direct advertisers I dealt with there had their agencies based in SEA. A few that had good budgets favoured local agencies, but most looked to have the cheapest offers possible.\n\n\nI precisely said in my comment below that the market is saturated because programmatic is a global business. Yes you need to have local knowledge about Media and laws, but most SSPs/DSPs help on that. I now even see clients in LATAM dealing with agencies in SEA on CTV!\n\n\nNorway is an expensive country. It'll be hard for you to expand internationally if you keep recruiting there. And if you're struggling to hire locally, that's another reason to do it internationally. There's talent everywhere. Great pro about AdTech is that remote work is not only possible but is highly recommended since monitoring campaigns can be 24/7, so having teams in multiple time zones helps on that.\n\nWishing you a successful path!",

Most media plans contain only TTD now.\n\nWe work with a lot of other agencies that don't specialize in programmatic, and brands who are programmatic-curious or have used other agencies and not had great experiences (which is common).\n\nProper expectations, a well-thought out ad tech stack, and high level of service are essential. Good reporting UX, pitching the right plan and interesting tactics for that client, etc... This is your \"product.\" The brand isn't going to feel the affects of any marketing campaign overnight, so all of this needs to come together at an elite level and if it does the brand will love working with you even if results don't exceed their expectations.\n\nAgree on talent - difficult to find really at all levels and roles, but not impossible. We have reached out to employed people at ad tech companies and agencies with fairly good results. If you have some senior leadership, hiring someone more junior and training from within is always a good option.",

Back in the days 5-10+ years ago you had agencies like Infectious Media that had a lot of success being programmatic only (they got acquired by Kepler). Bigger agencies caught up eventually or acquired their way in. Then Google entered the room (or more accurately grew into the whole room since they were there early on). Google inked exklusive global deals with big agencies, shutting anyone out who wasn't using their platform and so forth. Being a tech/agency type business like Infectious Media was back in the days is pretty impossible these days.
