      "body": "I did something similar to you - started at an agency as product support, expanded to product evaluations, partnerships, testing, contracts and negotiation.  I eventually transitioned to product management full time, and that was my out.\n\nThere are lots of roles in ad tech that still rely on partnerships teams to meet and evaluate potential tech.  Even technical companies need to work with vendors, build partnerships, maintain value, etc.\n\nIn all honestly, I believe our key asset is your ability to apply industry trends, and understand business impact.  There are plenty of programmatic traders out there, but there are less people who can understand the operational and economic impacts of a vendor, plan, or service.  I would stick on this track if I were you.",

      "body": "I am prob biased but everyone who works in programmatic whether its the sales, buying or anything else related should have some hands on keyboard buying experience. My advice would be to ask to run a couple smaller campaigns on the side with a trader mentoring you. Just having that experience will be helpful getting your next job and make you better at your current role. I know this doesnt directly answer your question but just my POV",

      "body": "I had a very similar role towards the end of my 6 year stint at a big holdco agency, only difference being I was HOK and managing programmatic traders before that. In my opinion, your product experience perfectly translates into a commercial/partnerships or product type role in ad-tech, which is what I've transitioned into. The only value the HOK experience now gives me is that I can better translate benefits of new product launches in sales decks when pitching and hold my own when speaking to more technical agency folk. Other than that, I think the HOK experience at this point in your career won't be a crucial element",
