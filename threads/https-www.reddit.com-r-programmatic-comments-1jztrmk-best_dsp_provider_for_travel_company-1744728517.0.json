Both considered to be tier 1 DSPs albeit with higher minimums and contract length than the lower tier DSPs \n\nIf you can't hit their direct minimums going through a good reseller agency is usual superior to using a 2nd/3rd tier DSP direct in my opinion.\n\nSome niche DSPs will assert they have superior capabilities on various industries but in my experience TTD and DV360 have the same audiences if not more so.",

I'd recommend looking for a DSP that doesn't have steep minimums and you can grow with. Ideal scenario would be the DSP could double as an adserver, like Adform so you won't have to pay separately for an adserver",

Love the opportunity to win your business. We have no minimums and sit on DV360 and Stack adapt, plus take low margins, brining the inventory to you for less and have custom CTV(remote interactivity) and Display creative as added value. We are tied in with Adara and work with a lot of travel and tourism as well and I can send you examples if you like. PM me or email me at christian@vdo.ai",

It supports contextual and geo-targeting, retargeting, and doesn't require massive budgets to start. The interface is intuitive, and you can scale as you grow. Great for testing travel ads before scaling up.",

TTD will likely get thrown out there, but they can be a bit pricey and require higher minimum spends. They're also all in on their new Ai driven platform Kokai, which feels suspect. \n\nI'd also check out a company called Anzira who has pipes into direct supply and is very travel focused. The issue you'll see with the standard DSP's like TTD, StackAdapt and Simplifi as mentioned below is that they're built to suit the masses. So they'll all have different variations of reporting, \"Ai optimizations\", and support, but at the end of the day, they all access the same inventory and 3rd party data.",
