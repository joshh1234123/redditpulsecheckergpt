      "body": "Criteo is pretty cutthroat for conversions. So that might work nice for you for retargeting. Stack adapt seems like a simpler interface than the trade desk, and ttd has very high minimum buys…but the lowest media costs. Adroll is extremely user friendly but you would need to provide them with documentation that you are legal to promote gambling. And their cpms are higher because they make money by marking it up. (I used to work there.) And then there is me, who would have to charge you a markup, but not sure if it would be a “huge” markup. I would buy for you on ttd or stack adapt.",

They want licenses for every country (and most the time these license they demand don't exist).\n\nIf you're doing crypto casino look at Match2One, Adform is want a proper seat and also Beeswax resellers like Datawrkz.",

      "body": "Simplest and cheapest way it is by utilizing past creative data, and then building up that audience… For example, you could just do it on YouTube using prior channels videos as a start… not sure how big the acct or client is tbh but if past ttd campaigns have recently ran, use those creatives like videos too. There’s so many different ways to do this, but it all depends on what you even have available or if you have site tags in place on the site or floodlights and so on. Another factor is how you were planning or wanting to retargeting customers and where from…",

And a random one you’ve probably never heard of - Vdx.tv actually has a casino and gambling team that’s good. They don’t advertise that they will do banner ads, but they do and at reasonable CPMs.",
