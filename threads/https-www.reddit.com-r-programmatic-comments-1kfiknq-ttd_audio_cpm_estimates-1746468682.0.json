      "body": "Regarding price, like others have said you’ll see most audio supply between $10-$25 CPM with more premium supply in the neighborhood of $20.\n\nRegarding metrics, it could be helpful to think of it the same way you think about metrics for a video campaign. If it’s a brand awareness campaign, your standard metrics should be reach / cost per unique user (CPUU) reach, with completion rate as a quality check (i.e., CPUU of $0.02 means one thing if your completion rate is 90%+ vs if it’s 50%).\n\nYou could also do a frequency analysis, ideally looking at frequency distribution to understand how many people you reached 1x/2x/3x etc. per week, month, or flight duration.\n\nJust like with video, you could look at conversion metrics if your customer wants to track conversions, but audio is likely not going to show the best performance on a CPA basis so I would treat this as a secondary KPI if anything, not the primary objective of the campaign.\n\nTwo things you can’t measure on audio-only placements are click and viewability metrics. The caveat would be if you’re running on supply that accepts companion banners for audio (where you’re serving a banner alongside your audio ad). Hope this helps.",

I do the same on CTV as well since both ad types don't get clicks. \n\nUnfortunately even at 20-30k/month you probably won't be able to go direct. \n\nTTD typically requires 12 month contracts and 100-200k/month media (data is additional)\n\nLet me know if you need a good reseller agency we sometimes use for some of our brands.
