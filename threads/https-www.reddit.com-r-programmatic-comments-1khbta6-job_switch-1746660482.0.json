Luckily I got the opportunity to grow into more of the programmatic director position allowing me to do more project based work, managed myself, while occasionally still doing some hands on keyboard work to stay up to date and support my team. That was the best thing for me as it wasn't too harsh of a transition, whereas my later swap to an adtech project management role was a much harsher reality check.",

Eventually this should enable you to start leading larger strategic projects. If you show results they will have no reason not to elevate you, based on your drive/initiative alone.\n\nYou will have to create your own position if your company is not set up to accommodate PMs. Most importantly you need to speak up and ask for more autonomy to be creative, or just show your initiative to lead.",

Unfortunately, as you grow in an agency the number of presentations either internally or client facing will only increase. If you're still interested in the trading side of things, but not being hands on keyboard non-stop, I would explore senior customer success roles at ad-tech companies you're passionate about",
