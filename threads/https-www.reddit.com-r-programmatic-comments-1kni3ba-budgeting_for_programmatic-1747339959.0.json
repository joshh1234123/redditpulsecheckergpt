ABM is technically possible but definitely curb your expectations…lead gen through programmatic For B2B is tough….not sure of the market size you’re going after…but most solution providers for B2B tend to offer solutions for large and enterprise level business but they will struggle to get you any significant scale or reach below that (without doing look alike…which you should stay away from).",
