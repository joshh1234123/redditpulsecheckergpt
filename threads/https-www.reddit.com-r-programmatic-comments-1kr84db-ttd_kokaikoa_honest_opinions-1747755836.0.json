      "body": "Nothing against the functionality, but ttd UI became shit and overloaded. The menu in style of a periodic system is not intuitive. The \"wizard\" when I want to create a campaign is also annoying. 2018 to ~2021 ttd was really good. Nowadays I just prefer any other DSP just to not having to use the UI. But hands down, in terms of features its probably the best DSP, except that you pay on average more than in any other DSP, as almost every feature costs extra money.",

I really think the new setup has a lot to be desired they def could have integrated more flexibility and metric filters. And they haven't had a single significant update since the release. Glad we use multiple DSPs and I don't have to use TTD if I don't want to.",

      "body": "We use TTD as our primary DSP. The platform is great overall, with more control and reporting than the vast majority of competitors. Kokai UI is a mixed bag, some really nice workflow improvements and some real head-scratchers. They are still actively updating it, it's clearly not in its final form.\n\nIn terms of Koa and AI features specifically - pretty surface level. You can choose which \"dimensions\" you want to have Koa optimize (device type, creative format, etc etc), which it optimizes towards based on the goal that you have set (ie CPA). There is an activity log that shows you when Koa makes changes, but not specifically what those changes were. You can however click into each of the dimensions to see what the current bid factors have been set to. You can turn Koa on or off for each of these dimensions individually.\n\nThere is little-to-no flexibility aside form setting the goal you want it to optimize towards - you can't set any rules or parameters for it to work within and you really have no insight into how it's actually making decisions. This is my main complaint. Even the option to choose aggressiveness or acceptable bid range would be nice. Analyzing the actual changes is tedious in most cases. Some (very few) have the goal metric displayed alongside those bid factors natively in the UI, so you have to pull manual reports and compare the performance for each dimension with the actual bid factor Koa has in place. \n\nIn terms of the actual optimizations it makes, they seem to be... okay? You would expect the bid factors to reflect the actual performance of that KPI, but they rarely do. They aren't ever horrible, but they aren't really ever spot-on. But again, you can't really tell what factors beyond just the goal KPI that it's considering. Is it considering scale/available inventory for each dimension alongside the KPI? Is it considering how other optimizations relate to each other, like device type and ad environment? We don't know.\n\nAs it stands now, it's good enough to use, but wouldn't solely rely on it for optimizations. Hardly a differentiating factor. It may be getting fed data more efficiently with the Kokai update, but from a user perspective it's largely in the same form it's been for quite a while with a few more dimensions that you can apply it to.",
