      "body": "It depends on how concerned you are about data leakage.\n\n\nIf you just mean getting it into someone's DSP seat you're basically describing data brokerage. There's many ways to market (as the comments will illustrate)\n\n\nThere are usually ways to provide custom segments only to a particular seat. This might be enough for your needs.\n\n\nIt is possible for data leakage though, either through something like TTD's REDS which provides log level campaign data, or by pixels in the creative. (This is true selling data as a curated deal as well)\n\n\nMore privacy-preserving would be something like Comscore's predictive audiences which can activate as probablistic contextual or maybe someone like Yobi that actually activates at a more broadly targeted level of resolution.\n\n\nThere isn't really a way to be precise and keep advertisers from building their list by renting yours.",
