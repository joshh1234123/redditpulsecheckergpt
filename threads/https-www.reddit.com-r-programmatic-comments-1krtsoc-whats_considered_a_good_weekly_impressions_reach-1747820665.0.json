Frequency is really important depending on the goal to. You might need to show the ads A LOT to a small group to drive engagement. OR a few ads across a broad spectrum to get high engagement people. OR lots of different ads over a long period of time to drive brand awareness.  \n\nSo.... it varies. Best practices is to have a few different creatives OR formats that overlap. So someone is more likely to see a CTV commercial, display, native, and video ad (plus social and SEM) vs just one type of ad or one creative.  \n\nBut if you only got $20k over 3 months then choose one format and focused targeting.",

      "body": "I think we need see other metrics as well if impressions is not your KPI. we need to have more impressions along with more clicks, this works for display ads. If not having more impressions and few clicks leads to low ctr and high cpc. So you ending up paying more without proper outcome from the campaigns.\n\nSo, better to think of placement and ad types. As each ad type will have different metrics to be looked after. Concentrate on all metrics required not only impressions.",
