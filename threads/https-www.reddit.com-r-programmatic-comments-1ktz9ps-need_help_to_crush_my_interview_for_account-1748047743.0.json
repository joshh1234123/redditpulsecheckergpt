I don’t think you will learn anything here that you don’t already know that will make a difference. \n\nJust focus on seeming genuinely interested in the company (you should know current events around it, value they are adding in market, etc), actually answer their questions instead of rambling about everything similar you may know, and come with some questions for them as well. \n\nYou will have time to organically insert your experience into the conversation. Also, people that work at agencies are going to be fairly desirable since you sit at the intersection of so many partners/vendors, and if you’re successful there it means you’re used to being in the shit.",
