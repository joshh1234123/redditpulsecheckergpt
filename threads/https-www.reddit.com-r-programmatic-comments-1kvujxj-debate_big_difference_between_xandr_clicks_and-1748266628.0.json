      "body": "Couples of questions and initial things to check:\n1. Are you using a 3P ad server to measure clicks independently of the DSP click reporting? You shouldn’t see a large click difference here, but could help you troubleshoot. \n\n2. Is your client utilizing a consent banner on their website / consent mode within GA4? Depending on configurations this would prevent ad tags / scripts from running, leading to discrepancies \nbetween platforms. On this note also check things like CSP policies as those can prevent scripts from running if not whitelisted.\n\n3. Review your session / engagement time settings in the analytics platform. Some clients will set their session metric to be a higher / lower time amount than others, so you need to see if that plays a factor. \n\nLastly, a reminder that a click doesn’t necessarily equal to a session, they are different metrics but like a previous comment noted - I’d personally switch from an ad click focused strategy as it’s too susceptible to fraud, click farms and potentially low intent users. You may be better off switching to a soft conversion strategy, where your display campaign is set to optimize off actions like ‘certain time spent on key pages, whitepaper downloads, etc.’",

Xandr does a decent job of reporting clicks for their own Exchange, but if you are buying from External SSPs (Magnite, OpenX, Pubmatic, etc), Xandr is not as good as stripping clicks and click counts may be inflated for those partners.\n\nOne other thing is we saw a huge spike in clicks and CTR from Glance. There is no way the CTRs we were seeing as reported in Xandr (2-5%) were valid clicks, so it could be a source with questionable clicks that Xandr is not determining are invalid and therefore they are being counted even if they shouldn't be.",
