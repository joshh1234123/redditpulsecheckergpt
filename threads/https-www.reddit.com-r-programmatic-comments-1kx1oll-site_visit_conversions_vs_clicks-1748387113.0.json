If the floodlights are set to respect consent banners, that would contribute to the discrepancy. \n\nAlso, check things like CSP policies as those can prevent ad scripts from certain domains if not whitelisted. \n\nLastly, certain browsers and devices will affect this - ex: Apple devices (ITP) as they have short cookie life spans (even with the FL setting it in a 1P context) - this can mess with the scripts ability to report on the ‘site visit’",

      "body": "Clicks are always going to be over-reported, pixel-based site visit metrics (like floodlight tags) are always going to be under-reported. \n\nFor clicks, this is because there are going to be accidental/fat-finger clicks where people click and exit before a page loads and the pixel actually fires.\n\nFor pixels, third-party cookies (which floodlight tags generally are) are going to be blocked on some browsers and when cookie tracking consent is not given. \n\nStill, 2k clicks compared to 10 site visits is extreme. I would double check both the floodlight setup and where this traffic is coming from, which could be from very low-quality sources that the campaign is prioritizing.",
