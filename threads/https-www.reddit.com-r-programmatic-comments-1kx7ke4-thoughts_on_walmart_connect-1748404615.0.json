Not really a reason to use the DSP if you’re not using the Walmart audiences or measurement but the DSP has the same workflow as TTD and the ad spend applies to our TTD MSA. It’s pretty straightforward to include in your portfolio especially for advertisers who sell stuff at Walmart.",

The walmart data is nice but the main benefit is the measurement and attribution, which it breaks down by delivery, pickup, and in-store. You can also view individual product purchases and revenue. If your client does a lot of business through Walmart, I would recommend it.",
