As for the second question, you can theoretically set those parameters on your end, yes, but you really need to talk to the publisher with whom you're engaging in a PG deal to understand if they want to allow that. Chances are, if you try to set targeting on your end without talking to them, they'll reach out to you asking about it because delivery will likely be pacing more slowly than they intended.",
