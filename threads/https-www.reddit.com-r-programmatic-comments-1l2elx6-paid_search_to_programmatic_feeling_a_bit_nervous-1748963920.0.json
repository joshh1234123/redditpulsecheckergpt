      "body": "This is a really big topic, and I'm sure someone else will have more in-depth advice to offer, but I think the *biggest* piece of advice I can provide is to do your best not only to understand the ins and outs of campaign setup and optimization but also to understand the programmatic landscape. There's a ton of jargon involved in programmatic, and I think once you start to get a grasp of how all the pieces fit together, it'll start making a lot more sense. \n\nRead up on ad exchanges, SSPs, programmatic deal types, ad inventory types, frequency management, etc., and use what you know about Meta and Google Ads to contextualize what's happening behind the scenes. Google Ads and Meta, for example, are just walled gardens that operate in a similar manner as what we think of as \"programmatic\" but they're confined to single platforms.\n\nThere are way more levers you can pull in programmatic compared to something like Meta or Google Ads to move campaigns in one direction or another, so having some understanding of all the different components in the space, even if you don't ever need to use some of them, is most important in my book.",

      "body": "Congrats on the new position!\n\nI'm actually trying to make a similar jump myself as I come from a direct sold ad ops background. I'm finding that the general structure of programmatic vs. non-programmatic Campaign set ups are very similar as I'm doing more online trade-desk courses(dv360, Amazon DSP, Meta Blueprint, TTD). The main difference being targeting and method of optimization. \n\nOne of the few tricks that I know for sure that's translatable is to rely heavily on previously run campaigns if you're offered a view in it. I remember when I started out in ad ops, I heavily relied on existing or past orders regarding settings that are the same from campaign to campaign. It'll also cut down on your time needing to ask questions. \n\nGood luck and would love to hear how it's going just to hear from a perspective of someone just starting out and if it's something I'm able to do. \n\nGood luck!",

Getting certifications is just the first step, but to become confident with any platform you need to put your hands on it. If you don't know something, you need to consult the help center first and also verify what is written directly on the platform. If you are not sure about anything, you'd better contact customer service. In the end, a DSP is not structured so differently from Google Ads (for example).",

      "body": "Don’t focus only on campaign results in the first few weeks - they’ll take time to show. From day one, pay attention to the quality of the inventory you’re buying: viewability, ad position, creative size, and contextual relevance. These are things you can control early, and they’ll have a big impact on long-term performance.\n\nIt’s easy to get caught up in CTR or CPA, but setting up proper supply filters and pre-bid logic from the start will save you a lot of time and budget later. Also, get into domain and app-level reports as early as possible - that’s where key patterns will start to emerge.\n\nglhf)",

The lingo and the interface are different, the targeting capabilities are way more robust and the ad formats way more diverse, but you clearly are eager to learn and I am guessing you'll pick up on things quickly- maybe even some things your new peers haven't caught. Ask questions, look up anything you don't understand, and dive in- it can be a fun world.",

Any time you come across a term, a setting, or some sort of interface you don't fully understand, look it up online. Programmatic expertise is earned by time spent in the platforms and learning the lay of the land just by poking around and exploring.",

Before AI, I relied on Google to find the information I needed; now, I turn to Copilot. This makes me wonder if studying PPC is still worth the effort. While many jobs still require expertise in Google Ads, social media will undoubtedly continue to play a significant role in the future. As far as I know, Instagram and TikTok are the most popular platforms right now, while LinkedIn remains widely used for B2B campaigns. We are in a constantly evolving landscape, but for now, studying social media seems like the right move.",
