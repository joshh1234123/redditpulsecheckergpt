      "body": "As others have mentioned, I’d recommend learning a bit more about programmatic advertising before jumping right into it expecting results. As someone else said, DSPs are just tools and not a magic solution that’ll automatically perform to your KPI.\n\nThere’s a lot of testing and learning to make campaigns perform to lower funnel KPIs like phone calls consistently. And even then, sometimes programmatic isn’t the right fit.",

      "body": "We need more context here. In one of your comments below, you mentioned: *\"I'm looking for direct calls from seniors—that's exactly what I need, no matter where in the USA.\"*\n\nWill the campaign target consumers or businesses? Will it focus on the USA? Are you planning to use different creative formats, such as YouTube, videos, display, audio, and DOOH?\n\nIf you're aiming to run a **performance campaign** with the goal of maximizing inbound calls, you should consider not just display but also **PPC channels** like Google Ads. Before subscribing to an insurance, people tend to research online, comparing prices and conditions.\n\nI would recommend using a **DSP** to integrate various creative formats and drive **high-quality traffic** to your website; not traffic measured solely by CTR or viewability, but rather by **qualified GA4 sessions**, such as users who spend a meaningful amount of time reading the product page.\n\nWith **Display & Video 360**, you can manage multiple creative formats within the same campaign. Combining different formats can enhance **brand awareness** and **consideration**, strengthening the upper stages of the purchase funnel.",

      "body": "For targeting seniors with life insurance in the USA, focusing on diverse creative formats is key. Google Ads and Display & Video 360 are solid options, especially for managing various formats like video and display ads, maximizing campaign reach, and improving qualified traffic to your site, not just clicks or impressions.\n\nWhen targeting seniors, it's crucial to engage across platforms, as seniors are diverse in their online habits. I've tried Google Ads and Display & Video 360 for multiscreen campaigns, but Pulse for Reddit works well to engage seniors within their communities. Each platform tackles different aspects of engagement, enhancing your overall campaign strategy effectively.",
