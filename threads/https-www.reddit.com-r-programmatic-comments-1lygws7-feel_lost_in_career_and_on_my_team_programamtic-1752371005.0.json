      "body": "Usually at least 2 hours of internal team/company calls, we have about 4-8 clients calls a day and I do all the campaign review for pacing and performance optimizations before their call (sometimes present on the call as well), review overall pacing (review reports and dashboards for under-pacing campaigns), and usually have 1 or 2 projects going on for account managers (like private marketplace deals and implementation, client requests, etc and a bit random). Outside of that if take care of billing and reconciliation mid-month.\n\nI haven't thought about ad-ops and will definitely consider it! Our ad-ops person does quite a few clients calls but I think its the nature of our team. I will check those positions out though. Thank you!",
