      "body": "Now that I have a little more time I want to give this a little more context and detail.\n\nSo to clarify I said nothing nefarious is going on, and there isn't, but id be mindful of a couple things.\n\nIf youre buying from an aggregator and youre getting all fast networks id be curious what CPM youre paying. One thing aggregators will do is put everything in FAST networks to increase their margin. If youre negotiating an aggressive CPM and that's what youre getting, totally fine. If youre paying a fairly high CPM (34-40) id be pressing to be on more premium networks. Ultimately they will say theyre following the audience which is partly true, but at that CPM you should be getting some Hulu, peacock etc.\n\nBut overall FAST networks I believe have gotten a bad name due to old school TV media buying philosophies. Media buyers who are used to buying cable would look at a report and be like \"look at this junk im on game show network, mtv2, fs2 etc\". With the assumption these are low viewed networks at off hours and nobody is watching. So people see these lesser known FAST networks and think similarly, not considering CTV is a 1to1. So while you pay more on cable to be on ESPN, that's because more people are likely to be watching. CTV gets served because a viewer has the TV on, whether its Tubi or Netflix. Now there's an argument to be made that the Netflix spot is more valuable because the user is paying for a subscription, so is more likely to be of higher quality. In addition, having your brand associated with Netflix and the high quality programs they put out is good for business. All thats true, but youre tending to pay an overinflated CPM for that while id argue FAST networks are undervalued.\n\nId just be mindful of the CPM your paying an aggregator if youre getting nothing but FAST networks.",

He falls into the “opinion elite” persona that these kind of advertisers often want to reach. An advertiser literally can’t reach us on “premium” ctv bc we pay to avoid ads. Just this weekend, we binge watched 2000s comedies. All on FAST.",

If you had Hulu through the same pipes it would be way bigger (not because of time spent but their bananas ad-load).",
