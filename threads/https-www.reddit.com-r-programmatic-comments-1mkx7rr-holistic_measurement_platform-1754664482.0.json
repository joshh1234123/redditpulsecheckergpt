      "body": "I wouldn't say any platform is perfect for measurement anymore, especially when looking at attribution.\n\nUltimately for programmatic, everyone cares a bit more about the value of an impression or view alongside clicks, so certain tech caters to this / adds to their measurement with certain caveats.\n\nSo you have the following:\n\n* **Adservers** : to which you have pointed out CM360 & Innovid as the big 2 in this space, with Adform no.3. They have the ability to track both impressions & clicks to form attribution both last touch and DDA where supported. But often they have to also model to account for limitations in signals like 3P cookies. Innovid and the fTrack ID in particular has its pros / cons from legacy Flashtalking\n* **Site Analytics:** your typical site analytics solutions, the most popular being Google Analytics still followed by Adobe Analytics / CJA and then the more bespoke ones like Matomo / Mixpanel etc. These largely can only track click based interactions, albeit Google are bringing more impression data to GA and Adobe can do it on Adobe platforms only\n* **MMPs :** may be a weird callout, but I see this as the dark horse of measurement, especially if you are running dual app / web properties and want to see the omnichannel view. The SDK approach of app and the nuances of measurement with SKAdNetwork etc has meant these guys have had to solve measurement a lot more technically than web, so the Appsflyer / Adjust / Branch / Kochava of this world have done a good job with App measurement and then rolled out their pixel to try unify it with web / CTV\n* **1st Party \"MTA\":** this is fairly specific to certain verticals but primarily ecommerce that may sit on a Shopify / WooCommerce setup. The rise of certain 1st party MTA solutions like a TripleWhale / Hyros / Northbeam or even DoubleVerify acquiring Rockerbox, that suggest that they can do things that not even Walled Gardens themselves can do but in reality there are some smoke & mirrors going on\n* **Data Clean Rooms :** with where things like commerce / retail media is going and the concept of a DCR, there is for sure a role of this in holistic measurement. InfoSum / LiveRamp are the big 2 from a neutral perspective but Walled Gardens have their i.e. AMC for Amazon, ADH for Google & AA for Meta. For Amazon, if you are not using AMC as an endemic brand, you are now at a disadvantage imo\n\nPlenty of choices / views you can have from all of those, but really the best in class measurement is to tie that together with experimentation / lift / incrementality testing alongside a more macro econometrics / MMM view. Attribution is part of that \"triangulation\", but is the least trustworthy imo.",

      "body": "Fantastic post. I think you buried the lede though. The cost of *not* doing incrementality experiments, lift tests, maintaining hold outs, etc means you do not have a mathematically sound (read: statsig) basis from which to make your decisions. Which means all of your other investments leave you, in essence, spending a fuck ton of resources to effectively be guessing. \n\nAnd then you look at big picture things like MMM. They are critical to inform budgets, but require substantial investment and transformation to provide the necessary data, data quality, data consistency to detect changes (which often means always on campaigns), etc.\n\nSo in some ways, the tech stack is really like having a fancy sports car. If you stick a student driver behind it, they may get from point A to point B, maybe the die or kill others on the way. But put a pro driver behind it and you can drive it properly.",

      "body": "Good analogy I like it! Agreed and getting those test designs in a good shape is a very underrated skill.  Still too many brands go heavy in retargeting because it \"looks good\" in attribution but don't realise there is very little incrementality to it.",
