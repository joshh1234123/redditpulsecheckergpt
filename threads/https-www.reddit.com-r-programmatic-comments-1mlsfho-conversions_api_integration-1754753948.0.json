But if you compare a Google / Yahoo DSP / Amazon DSP approach to those other channels, it can be quite messy sometimes, hence why IAB Tech Lab are trying to standardise it.",

It’s not like I don’t have partners that will help guide on this internally, but I’m looking for any gotchas or advice from others that may help make this a smooth experience for my client.",

It’s impossible for anyone to predict the hiccups you’ll run into because your clients tech stack will be a major factor in those hiccups, and the platform your connecting the data to is also a critical missing detail.",
