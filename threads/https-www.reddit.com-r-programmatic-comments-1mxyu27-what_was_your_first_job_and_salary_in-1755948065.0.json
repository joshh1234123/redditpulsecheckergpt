Took a pay cut to get a sales role in 2015, but it got me a foot in the door, and two years later was poached by a bigger DSP, by 2018 was a sales director (individual contributor).\n\nIn my experience (UK) it's a benefit, but ultimately you can learn a lot. I do wish I could see what other platforms look like (I am only really well versed in two major DSPs) so I think people with agency experience will have a leg up, but at the end of the day it is a sales role, so you need to have the sales mentality... ie be good at sales, you can learn any product/platform in a few month.",
