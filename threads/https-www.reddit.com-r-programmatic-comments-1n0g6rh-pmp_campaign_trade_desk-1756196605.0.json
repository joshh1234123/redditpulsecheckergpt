I would make ad groups based on size and device. Then maybe gender. Create a sitelist/applist and make some sitelist limited ad groups.",

Focus on bidding down or excluding placements that are too pricey. With that being said, still look at other reports such as device type, app environment, and audience segments to get a better picture of what may be causing your CPMs to be higher than expected.",

      "body": "I found that the best way to control CPMs (especially for CTV) is to negotiate 1P PMPs and not rely on the deals in TTD. They’ve become overpriced and don’t necessarily include the premium inventory indicated in the name. \n\nI would also disable the S&P 500. We found it inflated costs, while not improving performance. \n\nI would also keep your min and max bids tight to ensure that you’re maintaining control over costs.",
