      "body": "Yep. One of their per-employeement questionnaires was passed around (again) on Reddit and it is indeed totally devoid of relevant job questions and is indeed filled with really strange and vague questions that have no relevance to the job.\n\nThis is why I don't have a job at a big tech company. I have no idea what those weird questions are or how to answer them as they have absolutely nothing to do with the job I would be doing there. So, there's no point in even bothering throwing them a resume, because there's absolutely no way I can navigate that Machiavellian maze of total BS. So, there's no point...\n\nThey're clearly just creating a system where you're going to \"get one of the questions wrong\" so, they always have a technically valid reason to not employee you. It's totally one sided. It's actually impossible to answer the questions \"correctly,\" because the questions are worded in a way where they're so ambiguous, that there's no universally correct answer, because that's not how English works. It's like they're asking you subjective questions deterministically, giving you no valid range for an exclusively correct answer.\n\nSo, they don't care about my ability as a software architect, but it matters that I'm a Unix hater. Oh kay now... They couldn't put a bigger \"don't waste your time sign\" there if they tried. So, I have to hate an old OS that basically led to creation of the internet, because they don't like the licensing agreement? I can't actually work with people that are that totally dishonest.\n\nIf that's the culture of goons they cultivated over there, then it's for a sure a complete waste of my time. Obviously their products are filled with bugs and crapware. Obviously... It makes complete sense... They don't want the care bears that actually give a care and value what they're doing, they want the haters...",
