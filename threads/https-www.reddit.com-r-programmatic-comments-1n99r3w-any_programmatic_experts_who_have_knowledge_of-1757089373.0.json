Based on that you should start to look into metrics indicating uplifts. \n\nCtv is a great addition for upper funnel activities as you can connect it to other, more brand based media like atv / linear tv. Incremental measurement and targeting, is a nice side effect. \n\nWith deterministic and probabilistic tools,  you can also start to validate the impact, but I wouldn't go deeper into the measurement fetish, as it's still upper funnel.",
