It depends on what the product is and what qualifies as a \"lead\". \n\nTaboola and native placements work best when you are distributing content or have a landing page that is designed to inform and not just sell something. \n\nDisplay and video perform well, especially if you integrate CRM and the clients 1st party data. \n\nHappy to help with deeper strategy if you need, just let me know!",

Testing platforms like Taboola can definitely provide a fresh avenue for reaching potential leads, especially if you're looking to diversify your ad strategy. They often have unique placements that can catch attention in a different way than traditional ads.\n\nAlso, have you considered geofencing for your campaigns? It can be particularly effective for location-based targeting and might complement your meta ads nicely. Companies like GetGeofencing offer solutions that can track foot traffic and provide live dashboards, which could help optimize your lead generation efforts even further. Best of luck with your campaigns!",
