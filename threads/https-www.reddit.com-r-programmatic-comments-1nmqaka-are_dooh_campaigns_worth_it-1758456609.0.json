      "body": "You can approach this from the mindset of a consumer as well. Not only is DOOH traditionally known for brand awareness, but it’s also received a lot better than CTV and other video ads. You’re not interrupting someone’s movie or show 5+ times with the same ad. You’re instead sprinkling your message in front of them during their usual commutes/journeys. Because it’s less intrusive, it’s received better and people tend to have a better perception of the brand/message.\n\nPersonally, I hate getting ads on prime, Hulu, Netflix etc. and it always tends to be the same 2-3 ads. \n\nPlus with DOOH you can amplify it on social media and it makes the brand/message seem more legit.",

      "body": "measuring \"success\" for awareness/branding DOOH is tricky because we're looking at soft metrics. In my campaigns, I've used mostly Billboards, Urban Panels, Transit + Bus Shelters, and Taxi Tops.  \n  \nthere are options like brand lift studies (worked with mfour, Adsquare, and another third-party measurement partner, can't remember the name right now). Honestly though, I don't have much faith in these studies. And they are costly.\n\nbetter option: run a DOOH campaign, collect the device IDs from people exposed to your ads, then retarget those same IDs with Display/Video/CTV campaigns. Compare the performance against your regular campaign lines to see if there's any actual difference. Way more reliable than those brand lift surveys IMO.",

So it’s important to be really thoughtful in building the plan.\n\nI’d consider non programmatic partners first who own a lot of the best inventory.",

      "body": "DOOH is a very effective channel in the media mix, especially nowadays as consumers spend more time outside of their homes. I’d say campaigns I ran really well are the ones where the messaging is contextually relevant to the ad, for example a travel brand leveraging weather triggers. If you’re also buying other channels in an omni-channel DSP, OOH is a great way to drive depth and capture more market share based on which zip codes are driving performance on digital channels. Retargeting is also a great tactic, due to as someone mentioned before, receptivity for OOH is higher than TV or Digital and we use OOH to warm up consumers for higher engagement on lower funnel tactics. We’ve seen much shorter conversion windows based on reporting from TTD when OOH is in the path to conversion.\n\nIn terms of measurement, there’s been significant growth in the industry in the last 5 years or so. You can set up pixels on your landing/conversion pages and match deviceIDs of those exposed to OOH for attribution. I’d also recommend including OOH into your MMMs, and geo-lift incrementality tests. \n\nOverall, it isn’t fair to say OOH isn’t measurable and it’s just an awareness play. Tons of research and data out there shows that it’s an effective performance channel in a space that isn’t as saturated as what we’re seeing on CTV, digital and social.",

      "body": "Absolutely, absolutely, truly, DOOH is a worthwhile investment — but only if you want. If your objective is solely brand awareness, then DOOH shines because nobody fast-forwards it like they would internet ads. You get to see it out in the high-traffic spots — the mall, the airports, the subway stations, the congested streets — so basically, you’re paying for the unbeatable exposure.\n\nThat noted, however, it's not always the cheapest game in town, and the ROI is consistently harder to deliver compared to Amazon DSP or DV360. Where it does shine, however, is when you supplement it with your online campaigns. You’re exposing people online, for example, and then they also get your brand when they’re out walking around and seeing the big screen — the repeat exposure helps a lot for recall.\n\nIn terms of formats, I’ve seen transit screens, large-format billboards, and store DOOH do very well for awareness. The key is to keep the creative robust, simple, and loop-compatible since people only get a glimpse for a few seconds.",

      "body": "My answer would be similar to others, in that it’s a top-funnel awareness/branding play, and IMO, a worthwhile inclusion in what should always be a holistic approach to programmatic. You should message exposed user segments with sequential calls to action via display/video/CTV retargeting to drive them further down the funnel, (esp if attempting more of a direct response strategy seeking to drive lower funnel conversions). \n\nDOOH as a standalone tactic is prob not the best way to spend your clients’ budget if it’s small and only provides enough media buying power for a singular channel campaign. But if part of a multi-channel programmatic strategy, it makes a lot of sense as it’s less-intrusive, it’s “breaking a mold” or it’s “different” than other programmatic formats (not only in terms of look and feel, but certainly in terms of planning, etc) and it allows for logical QR code scanning and different types of interaction.\n\nI recommend getting in touch with a Vistar or Place Exchange rep and having them talk through their methodology, planning/forecasting tools, venue/screen types, etc and go from there.",

It can be worth it, but not if you’re chasing direct conversions.   \n  \nThe real value is awareness and brand lift, especially when you run it alongside mobile or display retargeting.Back in 2021, we saw the biggest impact when DOOH was combined with digital follow-ups — brand searches and direct traffic went up during those periods.Programmatic DOOH also makes a big difference compared to old-school OOH. You get dayparting, geofencing around key locations, and frequency controls, which makes the spend more efficient.   \n  \nSo yes, DOOH has value, but I’d treat it as an awareness driver that supports your other channels, not as a stand-alone performance engine.",
