      "body": "StackAdapt doesn't have any of its own inventory. It's just a DSP that taps into other inventory providers. DV360 will probably give you the most reach simply because it allows you to buy YouTube inventory, which is the biggest video service on the planet.\n\nAs a small business, you don't have a reach problem from my perspective. You'll likely never be able to spend enough money to penetrate the full market with your budgets, so you need to find ways to make more impact with less money. To your point, playing most of your ads on Tubi or Pluto might not be the best strategy, albeit people *do* watch these services, so I think you need to refine your buying strategy rather than rethink your DSP. DV360 and Amazon DSP might be too full-featured for what you're looking for since they're primarily designed for enterprise-level customers with bigger budgets. It's good that people have mentioned your ads when you were using DV360/Amazon in the past, so maybe you just found out YouTube is not the best way to engage people.\n\nIt's hard to make a full recommendation without more budget details and background info on your business, but you could honestly consider something simple like Universal Ads (Comcast/NBCU's self-serve ad platform that taps directly into their inventory) or Disney Campaign Manager (direct access to Disney+, Hulu, ESPN). Those platforms are more lacking in terms of targeting and whatnot, but they're also designed for SMBs and offer comparatively low CPMs. Universal Ads doesn't really have much targeting beyond genre targeting now, but you could get into some solid CTV inventory for like $8-10 CPMs, which could be effective if you're just trying to promote a brick-and-mortar location in a very defined geographic area. Disney Campaign Manager has more targeting options, but the CPMs are higher because the inventory is usually more competitive.\n\nEither way, I don't think you should be looking to add yet another DSP to your mix, and I don't think you need to turn to something like Tatari or MNTN because those are sus in my opinion anyway. If you're truly a smaller business, you could do well with Universal Ads or Disney Campaign Manager, or you could simply refine your buying strategies on Amazon and DV360.",

      "body": "Just to clarify for anyone reading this thread - StackAdapt is a DSP (Demand-Side Platform), not an inventory provider. As a DSP, StackAdapt connects to various supply-side platforms and exchanges to access inventory from multiple sources, but they don't own or control the inventory itself. This means the quality and type of inventory you get through StackAdapt depends on which supply sources they're connected to and how you configure your targeting and buying strategies within their platform. \n\nOn that note if you have access to DV360, there is probably minimal/specific use cases that Stackadapt has that DV doesn't. With fees in mind, you are probably ahead using DV. Esp for reach focused campaigns I would probably use DV but add in some further targeting rails. The lift study also probably depended on the investment level, nicheness etc...",

      "body": "i agree with u/Lumiafan on the buying strategy vs DSP selection to be the more important part of the equation.  There are so many DSP options out there with more middle men being added to the supply path all the time.  \n  \nThat being said, 1st party data targeting + premium CTV inventory  typically pay TV content at scale, think live sports, etc.) tends to be the 2 biggest factors for smaller budgets to be effective at a local level. \n\nWhat market/city are you in?  The top 50 markets will typically have a local ad sales division through the largest pay tv + internet service provider in the area.  the bigger ones will have a programmatic ad sales division that can get you that combo at a lower entry point designed for SMBs in the community.\n\nTop ISPs to consider will be Charter (ad sales division = Spectrum Reach) and Comcast (ad sales division = Comcast Advertising)",
