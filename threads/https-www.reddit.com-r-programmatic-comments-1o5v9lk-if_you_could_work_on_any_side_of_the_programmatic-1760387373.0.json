      "body": "When answering this question, think about where there will actually be work - who will be prospering in programmatic in the future? The answer is any programmatic not tied to a platform dependent on search referrals. So not publishers, not most middleware\n\nThere will be a medium-term future where Google removes most of the traffic referrals publishers get, in order to shore up its no-click AI offering, which it believes is the direction of travel. That may be five years, it may be two years, who knows -the the AI prize is too big for Google to ignore. So what does the ecosystem look like under those conditions, and who best to work for?\n\nPublishers will still exist, with much less traffic, and therefore much fewer staff. Subscriptions will be more prevalent than they are now, and most traffic (for large publishers) will be allocated to direct sales because of the higher yield. In other words, programmatic will take the hit. More publishers will outsource programmatic to the large aggregators in order to tie cost to revenue, but those networks will still see overall traffic declines and shrink themselves.\n\nWith less publisher traffic, SSPs and DSPs and all the middleware take the hit and also contract. Margins and volume decrease. This also affects retail media because there are fewer retargeting opportunities, CTV may be ok but the demand isn't there for many channels. Apps should be ok, if they can find new users.\n\nSocial, apps, CTV.",

      "body": "That’s a great question — and one many mid-career ad-tech professionals quietly wrestle with.\n\nThe truth is, most parts of the ad-tech chain (DSPs, SSPs, exchanges, data providers) are efficient but commoditised now. The real excitement and sustainability lie where the inefficiencies still exist — in areas that need innovation, not optimisation.\n\nTwo spaces worth thinking about:\n\t1.\tEmerging media formats – OOH, CTV, retail media — where the pipes are still being built and standards are unsettled. That’s where smart tech people can shape the rules, not just follow them.\n\t2.\tVerification, privacy and transparency tech – post-cookie, post-ID world, trust itself is becoming a product. The companies that make advertising provably fair and measurable will have lasting relevance.\n\nIf you’ve already done your time in the walled gardens and SSP world, maybe the next chapter isn’t bigger, it’s earlier — where systems are still messy enough to be interesting.",

Good benefits/good culture.\n\nI'll say this as a general response: It really depends where you're at in your career. \n\nIf you're just starting out, small agencies are probably your best bet - especially if that small agency also has some sites they rep directly. They generally won't be able to afford different teams for on-site, off-site, programmatic, social, search, etc- it'll all be one team, with everyone being big generalists. You'll be able to learn a lot of different platforms which will make you an easier hire for a bigger agency.\n\nDSP side generally is good salary/bonuses and healthcare packages, but not a ton of upward mobility, and depending how sales-focused your team is it can be pretty high-pressure(like if you're an AM), but if you're more on the execution side, things seem more chill.\n\n  \nBig agencies probably wind up paying you the worst, but they're good for exposure, especially if you want to get a DSP job- you'll make connections at all the big partners.\n\nI've never worked client side, but I've heard it's the lowest stress/highest security of all the options.",
