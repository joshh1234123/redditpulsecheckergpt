      "body": "TLDR: A federal judge ruled Google violated antitrust laws by monopolizing publisher ad servers and ad exchanges while illegally tying its ad server to its exchange, though the company escaped liability in the advertiser ad network market. The case now enters a remedies phase where the Department of Justice is pushing for divestiture of Google's ad tech business, potentially forcing a major restructuring of digital advertising's dominant player despite concerns that breaking up the company's tightly integrated ecosystem could harm publisher revenues.",

Google's lobbying money has been peanuts compared to how much money they've made in the meantime. It's certainly one of the highest ROIs in history. After all, Google's simply followed in this suit case what their own teams recommend to clients when ROAS goals are not reached: increase (lobbying) budgets.\n\n\nBut it's too soon to call it a win. With Trump, everything is negotiable because everything is a deal.\n\n\nFinally, I have sympathy and respect for Google employees. They've built amazing products, whether in AdTech or not. Their work has hugely influenced the internet we know today. But, as usual, greed got them out of the way, and let's be honest that greed would've gotten everyone of us out of the way - we all have a Bezos inside us.",
