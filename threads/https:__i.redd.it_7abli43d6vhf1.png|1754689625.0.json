While you make a great point on the market valuation not growing over the past 5 years compared to the broader S&P, TTD has continued to deliver 18-25% (rough estimates) revenue growth quarter on quarter for years.  In fact, they’ve hit 33/34 earnings, including a beat this quarter with 19% growth.  (Which far outweighs google growth.. especially their DSP which I believe was flat/down in their breakouts).   Jeff cannot control how the market reacts to earnings… in fact, I’d argue the market is fairly irrational and driven more by options these days than earnings.   For example, look at IAS.  They grew by 16% (less than TTD, with a lower profit margin) but the stock jumped 12%.   My point is, you’re conflating stock price and company growth, which don’t always correlate.",
