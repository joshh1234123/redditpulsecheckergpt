      "body": "Maybe I don’t have the full context, but when I saw the TTD Trader slide I interpreted it as an internal review deck instead of something that was supposed to represent external opinions. \n\nEither way, I was in a trader role for agencies of all sizes- from global holding co to local independents. Each place took my (and other media trader/buyer) opinions into consideration since we were the SMEs. \n\nThe difference is that the larger the agency, the harder it was to make any sort of changes. Like with a holding co agency (IPG, Omnicom) it would take multiple years just to onboard a new DSP. Whereas with small-mid size agencies it would take a month or two max.",

      "body": "It’s weird that TTD quoted their own employees. It’s not like they’re going to be honest if the think the product is shit. I honestly feel bad for TTD traders. Most I’ve worked with are legitimately bright and kind people, and the past 2 years my reps have had to put on a shit eating grin and pretend that heap of garbage Kokai was an upgrade.\n\nThat said, most agencies don’t give a shit about their traders’ opinions. They’re seen as task rabbits. I’ve seen way too many IOs sent my way with poorly selected KPIs and even worse targeting. I’ve found the quality most agencies value in traders is speed and accuracy. Having a well informed opinion is usually seen as an annoyance because “we already sold in CTR as the KPI to the client”.",

      "body": "Trading / Optimisation is evolving imo. TTD effectively built on what AppNexus was in the past: the trader DSP paradise for advertisers/agencies who liked to get into the weeds of programmatic.\n\nBut due to all the shifts in the ecosystem but notably the AI machine learning push, manual trading is not completely irrelevant but for sure differs today. Is Amazon P+ the greatest campaign type ever? Hell no but that pivot is noticeable/will only get deeper with agentic workflows.\n\nPreviously advertisers always wanted to talk to the hands on keyboard person vs an account manager who knows very little. Now id say it's more about the analytics/insights to unlock the strategic value of programmatic (e.g. AMC with Amazon DSP).\n\nFuture of trading for me is that analytics piece in tandem with tech on top e.g. custom algos, which is a skillset not every current trader / agency has.",

You know an agency/vendor values their traders when you see traders equipped with decision-making power and influence across the sales cycle: from the pre-sales stage to the planning stage to directing teams how to answer client questions. That is what a trader-run culture looks like, and the best companies have it.\n\nIf the agency/vendor has the traders taking media plans and pricing orders from someone with little knowledge of media (sales and planners who’ve never actually traded), you know it’s a shit show operation.",
