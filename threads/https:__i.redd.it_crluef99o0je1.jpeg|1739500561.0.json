And this has translated into solid financial results over time, targets have been hit consistently every quarter over the last years.\n\nBut I also thought for a while that their valuation was so so so inflated. Multiples were THAT crazy.\n\nA small correction, even if this one seems harsh considering they slightly missed the target, isn't that dramatic. It's just a normalization effect.\n\nNothing to worry about in the end, just a bit of normal adjustment that should have happened anyway and might happen again.",

      "body": "My quick take, TTD likes to play up the “open web” and agency or CTV talk but those dreams are dead. What is the open web today? It is a half lit candle in the wind. If anything Google helps it stay somewhat alive but people much prefer apps over browsers.  \n\nI don’t entirely follow your DV360 or YT influencer arguments. YT is old and has found ways to stay increasingly relevant. \n\nI think TTDs ID approach is risky and not meant for the long run. Hashed emails joined from “open web” properties, pass. TTD desperately wants its own inventory and data but their whole shtick was the opposite. \n\nTake my notes with a grain of salt. I’m a decade plus ad tech veteran who is grumpy about the state of the world. If I was an advertiser or investor, I would focus on  vertical ad solutions.  \n\nSide rant, the mainstream open web is garbage today. Ads… ads and more shitty ads. I spend more time on discord or YouTube premium than any other domain. I grew up during peak early 00’s internet and witnessed Web 2.0. I prefer LLMs over some curated blog or news domain because the experience is without ads. Again, grumpy elder millennial who doesn’t use tik tok or instagram or shorts. I think ad free solutions will grow. The time has come. Sure potentially smaller market but for a certain demographic it will be the only path forward. ",

When you are talking about a refinery, if you have way more oil than demand for gas, you do have a problem, the price plummets. It could be that  in an effort to build comprehensive pipes, they have so much oil available that they can't keep downward price pressure from buyers from affecting their overall numbers. It's over supply constraints. Still, they have healthy margins, and if there is price pressure, it will be across the board affecting competition as well. \n\nBut I don't think it signals a shift back to performance or direct response. If anything, I think it signals a demand for more transparency and better measurement.",
