Nobody at The Trade Desk ever tried to “pass off” staff feedback as client testimonials, the UI was in *internal testing only* until yesterday. Clients didn’t even have access to this version of the platform before then.\n\nWhat actually happened is very clear: like any software rollout, Kokai went through an internal QA and trader-testing phase.  Feedback from TTD folks who had been using it in practice, precisely because clients hadn’t yet been onboarded. To spin that as some kind of deception is just grasping at straws.\n\nThis is consistent with a broader pattern: Trishla frequently gets core details wrong and pushes click-driven headlines rather than context. If accuracy matters, it’s worth checking her reporting against the facts, because her last few pieces aren't just misleading, they're false...",

Everyone (and I mean *everyone*) at my agency still uses Solimar. Our other TTD reps aren't thrilled about that.\n\nWhat's made even worse is that there's still Kokai functionality missing, so it'll kick you back to Solimar sometimes. And there's plenty of Solimar UI that is carried over from Next Wave, such as the entire reporting interface. It's an absolute cluster.\n\nBut, yes, as other commenters have said, if you know what the job titles at TTD are generally then you'd know immediately these are staff. This likely only fooled prospective clients if anyone, which is still not great.",
