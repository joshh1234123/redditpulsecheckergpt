I work on the supply side, and we frequently have to block advertisers from bidding into our supply based on their creatives, or who the advertiser is.  I don't think they blocked you to force you into buying at a PMP price, I'm guessing they have a content team who blocked you.",

It's important to create a new line, otherwise the avg cpm will have in consideration your history with 0.3. \n\nIf you then on Monday are still losing all inventory, and if you want to continue buying Tinder, then yes, you will have to buy via PMP. I would also try to duplicate the creatives and associate them to the line... together with the old ones. Just to see if they are just blocking the creatives... but I guess they just define a price rule for you.",
