      "body": "It’s a big issue IMO that not just Publishers face, but they certainly get the brunt of. The delay comes from advertisers not paying fast enough. Likely bc they can get away with it and are the bullies here, not for any good reason. Of course when you get paid quickly, your liquidity is better, but Pubs are working with dozens of partners at a time and one bad link can break the chain. \n\nWhen it comes to paying Publishers, you are looking at SSPs or direct to agency/advertiser. SSPs default to n60 or n90 but this is negotiable and ive gotten plenty down to n30. They get paid by the DSP, Agency, Advertiser who has some other n60-n120 on them. Big guys like Google or Magnite have cash and can float you, others are scrambling to reconcile behind the scenes. \n\nGoing direct to a pub, advertisers/agencies usually have a much longer timeline, n90-n120, likely bc they are waiting for the client cash. I have seen publishers cut back quarters bc their 1M deal wasnt being paid out for another 6 months.",

      "body": "You have to realize how the chain of funds work here and that is exactly why it takes so long. \n\nSo an agency buys media on behalf of a client/brand through some sort of platform. The media runs and then the billing cycle starts:\n\nPublisher issues invoice to platform or agency.\n\nIf a platform, then the platform has to then invoice the agency.\n\nThe agency then needs to verify that the invoice is correct, that delivery actually happened, that there is proof of performance, and that it matches a purchase authorization from the client and the purchase authorization from the agency. \n\nThe agency then needs to Bill the client/brand for the media that ran plus the agency's work in managing it. \n\nEvery step of the way has 30 days of payment terms attached to it. So at the very minimum republishers looking at 90 days in a perfect world. 120 days is more realistic. \n\nThen imagine you're some huge international brand and that your contract with the agency says that you will only pay your invoices from the agency in net 180 days. You have that negotiating power because you're spending millions and millions of dollars with the agency and you'd rather hold your money and invest it than pay invoices in 30 days. \n\nI'm not saying any of this is okay. I'm just saying this is how media procurement works and why it takes so long for publishers to get paid at the end of the day. \n\nAnd we haven't even gotten into invoices that don't match delivery or the purchase authorizations or clients that go out of business and don't end up paying... All this can extend payment periods even longer.\n\nYou can offer the agency discounts for paying early, but the reality is they don't have the money to do that and they're not willing to take the risk in the interim while the client pays them. It's futile to think about this shortening this cycle at all.",

      "body": "Not that big an issue. Major SSPs float the cash and should it be withheld later the pub finds out later. \n1. Delay is not noticeable. It’s the clawbacks that are painful and unpredictable \n2. It is not a thing.\n3. Publishers always preferred to be paid sooner. This is part of the reason why Google is so popular.",

      "body": "Thx for the solid breakdown - really appreciate the detail. Im new to digital advertising and just getting my hands dirty with it, so this really helps.\n\nFrom what Im seeing, it does seem like publishers are getting the short end of the stick. I heard from TTD that they process ad revenues on a n120 cycle, which I guess is partly because they are also dealing with delayed payments from agencies/advertisers or maybe they can also do it.\n\n> I have seen publishers cut back quarters bc their 1M deal wasnt being paid out for another 6 months.\n\nI was wondering - don’t they have contracts that require agencies to pay by a certain time? Or is it more that, even with these terms, publishers avoid the hassle of litigation unless absolutely necessary?\n\nAlso, curious to get your take on big publishers like FT. they’re not just relying on ad revenue; a lot of their cash flow is probably coming from subscriptions. Do you think they’d be open to faster payment terms (say within 10 days) if they had to take a discount? So say after the initial burn period, the publisher's cash flow starts stabilising with a predictable stream they can count on to keep ops running. Does that upfront payment in 10 days really bring much to the table? Why would a publisher sell off ad slots at a discount when they could just sit tight, wait the n120, and pocket the full amount? Would love to hear about the pitch here that makes that quick cash worth the haircut?",

      "body": "Realised I didn’t explain the quick payment process - sorry for any confusion there. So here’s the idea: imagine there are investors willing to take on some risk. Picture a setup where a group of speculators comes in, buys up ad inventory for a fixed period (say, 6 months), and pays the publisher upfront (obv only doing it if there’s money to be made). During that 6-month period, any revenue from ad impressions would go directly to these holders. This lets publishers hedge their revenue stream, dodge the usual cash flow crunch, and handle the working capital needs upfront. And as long as the publisher is aligned to maximise ad revenues, the investors likely won’t mind what the publisher’s doing. Curious if you think something like this could work in the real world?",

      "body": "Basically what you said. Contracts dont mean anything. Big companies typically dont pay late but it’s essentially just a date for you to get legal involved if not paid. Then that’s drawn out and smaller pubs cant afford litigation either. Suddenly n120 is n150 and it “will never happen again 🥴”\n\nIf the payment is sped up enough, idk like to n60 instead of n120 and the revenue is substantial, i can see certain companies accepting something like that but sets a precedent that isnt very favorable. More revenue diversity helps keep all departments afloat so I can also see someone like FT not giving as much of a shit for standard media campaigns if x% of revenue is coming from more reliable sources. A few SSPs actually offer a faster payment if you provide an extra 1 or 2% per month.",

They would assume the risk of actually selling the smaller sections and the magazine theoretically would get their money no matter what. Similar things would happen with late night TV for direct response advertisers.",

      "body": "thanks for the insights. Invoice trading is a decently big business for banks but they engage in it for large companies when they know with high prob that the invoice will be processed. \n\nIn the scenario I mentioned the publisher is auctioning off the rights to the ad revenues for the next 6 months(could be anything) to outside investors - theres not even an invoice generated yet. plus I think theres often a discrepancy in the invoice amounts anyway. But it's still the publisher job to focus on what it does - write good content + maximise ad revenues. \n\n>Anything's possible but I don't see someone taking on inventory risk who's not either a principal in buying or principal in supply ownership.\n\n  \nI get where you are coming from, but this could play out a bit like agri futures. In that market, you’ve got plenty of investors and speculators who arent the actual producers or end users of the commodity yet they are willing to take a position because theres enough liquidity and a secondary market. Ad inventory could follow a similar path if a market with decent liquidity develops. If it turns into a recognised asset class with some level of predictable valuation, you'd likely see traders stepping in. ATM i think only the ad tech players know how to price it out, but if the market takes off, I expect others from outside coming in, seeing value in it for diversification or even short-term gain or even for pure speculation. took me some time to process and accept it-if there’s money on the table, there’ll always be someone ready to YOLO it.",
