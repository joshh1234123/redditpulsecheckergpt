With the rapid rise of CTV and programmatic linear starting to become a method of buying via traditional DSPs in some markets, there will be growing interest in data companies like Spectrum Reach to facilitate measurement and addressability\n\nI think you'll have more to offer by staying where you're at and trying to see what role you can play upselling/partnering services and measurement angles with the more traditional DSPs than becoming a sales person at a DSP",

I’m more so looking for career advice based on the perceived concern that as linear subs shrink, Spectrum will have less of a differentiator versus DSPs that can aggregate audiences beyond what we have access to",
