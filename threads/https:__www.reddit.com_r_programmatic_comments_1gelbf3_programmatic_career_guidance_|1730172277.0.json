On the flip side, if it's not a top 5 DSP, then it gets really tough. Outside of the top 5, it's allncopy/paste, white label shit and a race to the bottom so it gets really boring.",

Think about not just this role but the next one after. \n\nIf you want to a wider career outside programmatic with a big agency you can start looking outside from trading, accounts, and planning with buying experience and it's easier.\n\nIf you want to dive into ad tech, a DSP is a great place to start and move around towards other parts of the ecosystem easier. You'll still have to work with agencies as majority of them are going to be your client.\n\nI think the biggest one is it also depends on the DSP is also if you're going for the big ones great, the smaller one are harder to sell because they'll have to fight in service if the tech is the same.",

A lot less fires to put out, better hours, etc.\n\nIf your priority is stability, ask the agencies about account diversity. Are they hiring for one client and will you have only 1-2 major accounts? Or will you be diversified across 3-5 accounts? For the Dsps, ask them what their clientele is and what their contracts look like, aka annual, month to month, minimums etc. This will give you an idea about how large clients are, and how much potential stability there can be.\n\nIf you are valuing exposure to Tier 1 programmatic platforms, agency is the way to go. You'll get access to platforms like DV360, TTD, Datorama, Taboola, Tableau, etc. \n\nIf you're valuing deep understanding of the programmatic ecosystem and buying best practices on one platform (that can later in your career be translated to a different dsp as needed) to really become a programmatic expert, go with the DSP. \n\nIf you enjoy vendor dinners/events as a job perk, go agency.",
