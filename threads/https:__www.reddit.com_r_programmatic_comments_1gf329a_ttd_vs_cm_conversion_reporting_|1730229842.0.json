The first thing I would check - do you have identity alliance turned on in TTD for the reporting columns? If so, it's likely recording a lot of cross device conversions that CM360 can't pick up. I would turn that off.",

      "body": "As as first step, I would check whether your TTD & CM attribution events and lookback windows identical? If not, you'll need to check all of the other points listed below by others. Is CM tracking more media, or just your programmatic? Are you measuring on the cross-device level in TTD using identity alliance? What's the make-up of spend and conversions attributed to environments and browsers which have more restrictions around cookie-based tracking like Firefox, Safari and IOS devices?\n\nPinpointing the exact 1-1 reason might not be possible, but there's absolutely a lot of different ways you can dissect and analyze the different data-sources to better understand what could cause this and from there look into ways to get these figures more closely lined up",

CM might be attributing credit to campaigns lower in the funnel like search unless they account for multi touch attribution.",

These are just two different worlds and there is no point in running TTD if you measure it in CM - TTD gives the opportunity to measure CTV, Safari, cookielees environments etc. Also, it will be worse and worse in the future.",
