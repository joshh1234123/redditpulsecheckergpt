If I showed you 10 ads and 3 were ones I knew you saw last week could you pick them out for me? \n\nThe lack of understanding about ad recall is a real issue, realistically few people are going to remember your ad a month later so why be concerned about the frequency. You’ll be lucky if they remember your ad a week later.\n\nI suggest using a cap duration that reasonably represents the amount of time a user might remember your ad and then go from there to balance being annoying.",

Is it a dynamically growing audience, or static in size?\n\nThe max possible frequency would logically be 4x40=160 but that's assuming the audience remains static over the duration of the campaign and you're only serving against users with cookies/IDs associated with them. In reality, the number will likely average out far below that 160 and probably you will even struggle to see an actual average of 4 exposures per day if your audience is of large size etc",
