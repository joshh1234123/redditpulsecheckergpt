      "body": "If DV360 traffic is now showing up as \"google/cpc\" in GA4, it might be because auto-tagging is on, which changes your UTM tags. Since auto-tagging can’t be turned off, here are some ways to fix it. You can try setting up special labels to separate DV360 traffic from Google Display Network (GDN) or use Google Tag Manager (GTM) to add different tags. A tool like Qwestify can also help sort this data, so you can clearly see the traffic sources.",
