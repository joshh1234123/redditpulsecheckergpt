They’re just another platform that found a niche that’s underserved.\n\nThe other claims are pretty standard - the first bullet is about conversion methodology and using log data effectively; the second is about inventory curation.  Nothing about those points are unique, and many vendors in the space do the same things.\n\nProbably built it on Beeswax, but could be TTD.",
