      "body": "Thanks for the reply. Yes, I'm with one of those resellers. But I can only get as far down as the managing partner cost. My question would be can I do self-service directly with TTD without the middleman (reseller)?   \nI assume it would mean larger commitment and less support - which I'm fine with. But does anyone have any experience with working with TTD directly?",
