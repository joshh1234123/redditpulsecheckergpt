No offense to u/tahadharamsi , but TTD is mentioned a lot. \n\nOP, for what its worth I worked in a big six agency for years and years. I never liked TTD, I found them to be as arrogant as Google in some ways.\n\nGenerally, most reps were really good. It's a tough job so I always tried to accommodate where possible.",

      "body": "Google service quality varies pretty drastically depending on the size of the advertiser. Top spenders get dedicated coverage plus extra agency specific support if it’s through a major holdco. Even within that top tier support, sales reps’ knowledge and helpfulness can still be pretty hit or miss\n\nIf you get a rep that actually spent time trading, they’re usually on par with any other DSP rep. It drives me nuts when I can tell that the person trying to sell me on DV360 has never used the platform themselves. Sadly that doesn’t seem to be a prerequisite to work at Google/DV360, plus you end up with a separate rep for YouTube specifically and those people know even less about DV360",
