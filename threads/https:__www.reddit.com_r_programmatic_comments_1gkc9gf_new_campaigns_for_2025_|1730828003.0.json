Yes you essentially reset the \"algorithmic learning\", but from a financial management POV and understanding the changes you go through over the course of the years to account set-up this becomes a lot easier to manage long-term.\n\nTake it from someone whose onboarded several global accounts at a big-6 holdco, but taking over a legacy tech-stack. It's very challenging to work through, or ask all the clarifying questions why things might be the way they are if campaigns aren't reset every now and again.",
