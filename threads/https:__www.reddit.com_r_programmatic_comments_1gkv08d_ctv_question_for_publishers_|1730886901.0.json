      "body": "It's a bit hard to give clear advice without understanding whether the publishers deem themselves to be quite premium, or not. In my opinion, you're better off creating your own app and control how all the monetization will work. However, completely appreciate this might not be realistic for your business.\n\nPersonally sit on the buy-side, so would just urge you to carefully consider who you'd wanna partner with for selling. If you're partnering with a reseller that sells lots of \"shitty\" ctv supply, you'll likely not see the revenue figures you're looking for etc.",

      "body": "For one of the publishers, it's like music videos and performances and for the other it's short mini round-up sports content. \n\nWith the CTV partner we going to go with, their suggestion/sell to the publisher was to essentially \"package\" up their existing short-form content into more of a \"block\" of programming. \n\nSo, using the music content as an example, it would watch as a block of performances in like 20-30 minute \"show\" format. A Top of the Pops-like setup for instance that would be branded as the publisher's \"Show\" on the network's \"Channel.\"\n\nAs I understand it, they would wrap the pre-roll, mid-roll, and post-roll around the content and that is how the publisher makes the rev. \n\nTheir angle was that they were the ones tasked with pushing their channel and had all these deals in place to help ensure the content would be seen and thus earn the pubs rev.\n\nWe didn't go with them in the end, but that setup appeals in that it simply lets the pubs use their existing video library to make more rev without the need for much maneuvering or manpower. With the already rocky roads of display etc, for the size of pubs I'm referencing (mid), it feels way more appealing/advantageous to onboard a moving train than having to build out their own (re CTV). \n\nAny insights on how to go about achieving this or the established players that operate in the way outlined (e.g. accepting premium content of this ilk) would be greatly appreciated.",
