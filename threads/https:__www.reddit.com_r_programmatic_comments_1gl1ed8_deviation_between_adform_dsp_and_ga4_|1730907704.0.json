      "body": "Use Adform quite regularly, and the data will never match. GA4 only measures post click data, which for display tends to be quite poor, especially on mobile. Adform is measuring post click and post impression and also measures cross device activity (if you have it implemented).\n\nYou can pull a custom report in Adform which will measure post click vs post impression visit activity. Post click activity in Adform should be very close to GA4, depending on your implementation.\n\nI often have conversations with my clients that “clickers aren’t converters” and to understand that post impression visits do happen and GA4 will not track",

I'd recommend playing around a bit with custom report setups or there are already premade reports like top content where you can toggle different things like post clicks vs post impressions, uniqueness, etc. What's the most painless way to get help is to contact support - either directly through the platform(if I want to have something solved fast) or your representativen(more long-term/complex problems). Good luck and if you find a solution, post follow up.",

      "body": "Exactky what u/al-j- mentions below. GA4 and all other web-analytics companies, rely on post-click measurement only to attribute what paid-channels contribute to traffic to site. That's the primary reason why there's a deviation.\n\nYou should be able to report on post-click conversions from Adform and compare those to your GA4 numbers. If that's showing significant discrepancies, you may have to review your GA4 and Adform attribution windows, conversion events vs. GA4 sessions and whether your UTM structure is firing correctly.",

In the cases I have seen the visits match pretty closely to the clicks in the other systems but session times are zero.\n\nYou can check if the landing page for your clicks has an immediate redirect, for example a didicated high traffic landing page to the actual page. GA4 does not like that at all. All the comments about view vs. click attribution are also a big thing to consider. \n\nBy the way, how high are the discrepancies?",

      "body": "The difference between Adform DSP and GA4 data is common because they measure sessions differently. To reduce the gap, try using UTM parameters or adding a unique identifier to track sessions across platforms. Also, tools like Qwestify can help ensure GA4 data is accurate and synced properly for better insights.",

I'd also double-check any identity based solutions that might be enabled in Adform which others have also mentioned and see if that's the cause. Additionally, look into whether the Adform conversion is attributed to the last click, or first-click/first-touch etc.\n\nHaven't worked in Adform for some time, but those are typically the main causes with other channels and DSPs. Good luck it can get hard to pinpoint exactly!",
