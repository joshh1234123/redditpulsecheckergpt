They only do hourly reporting.\n\nI know a lot of people who use Adbutler but can't use GAM because Google is blocking everything. I'm unsure if they have real-time data.",

For context, if my DSP gave me this reporting in real time I wouldn’t be looking for an ad server. But there’s a 3-4 hour delay. Adbutler can do this to some degree but I’m looking for alternatives if there are any.",
