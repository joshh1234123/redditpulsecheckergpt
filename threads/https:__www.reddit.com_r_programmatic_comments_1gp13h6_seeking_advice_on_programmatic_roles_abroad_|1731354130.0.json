London is a massive hub for the industry, with almost all ad-tech companies having EMEA offices in or around London. However, you can also look at roles in Amsterdam as almost all Holdco's have large programmatic hubs in Amsterdam nowadays to service global accounts. I know IPG services Nike specifically, primarily out of Amsterdam, Dentsu does Heineken and a couple of others from Amsterdam, and believe GroupM also still has a big Adidas team out here.",
