      "body": "Similar to the comments below, a bit unclear around what exactly your offering is but in my opinion the below figures are what I'd go with;\n\n\\- Buying platform fees: 5-10%  \n\\- MS Fee: 15% sounds steep, but depends on the amount of time/resource needed to manage the MS activity and whether there'd be minimums associated with it. Depending on how high you'd expect budgets to be, it might be worth pushing self-serve only\n\n\\- Targeting/Data-fees: Depends on the quality of the data and source. High-value retail data up to $2, anything else should be less",

      "body": "Start with the 15% markup as the base value for ssp media fee.\nI would also bake a minimum cpm that makes my infrastructure costs per impressions to be always covered.\n\nPlay with this around to what happens to your fill rates and results. Maybe at 20% you will earn more profit and nothing changes, maybe at 10% your fill rates increase and your bottom line is bigger.\n\nMake sure the bottom line make sense for your business unit and tech fees.",
