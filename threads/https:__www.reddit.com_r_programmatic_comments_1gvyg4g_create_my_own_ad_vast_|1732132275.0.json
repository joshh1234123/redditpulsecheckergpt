And they'll generate a vast tag you can use. \n\nIt might feel silly having them ad serve (there are ad serving costs) a video you have / host, on a site you own / host (if I'm understanding your post correctly) but it would give you additional reporting metrics, potentially. \n\nNow that I'm typing it, there's gotta be a better solution for creating your own vast tag but the above I think could work.",
