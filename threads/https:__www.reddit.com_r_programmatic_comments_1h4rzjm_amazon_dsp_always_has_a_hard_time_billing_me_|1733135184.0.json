      "body": "I’ve been experiencing issues with Amazon portals in general while using Chrome but have noticed it once I added DSP. As we use 5-6 solutions for various reasons (Sponsored Ads, Amazon DSP, S3, Developer, FireBase, engineer might have others), I believe there is a bug while they allocate access for each dashboard on the backend.\n\nRegardless, try using a different browser. Otherwise, you might get some assistance by submitting a support ticket. They understand on the DSP side that time is money and users’ unable to access their own account is a big problem internally.",
