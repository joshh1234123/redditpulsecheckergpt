      "body": "Having previously worked on agency side for many years, it's amazing how many digital planners/buyers have no clue how their 3rd party vendors secure their inventory. Even senior agency people don't understand this. Which leads them to placing multiple vendors on plans that are not only bidding against each other, but also bidding against the agencies own internal trade desk. It all stems from the almost complete lack of training media agencies provide to their staff.",

Always find it odd that agencies don’t want someone from publisher side. But it’s not like I’ll go to agency side anyways. They can’t afford me lol and rather have a work life balance.",

      "body": "Depending on the role, they might just want someone they can plug in faster. Someone who already knows their DSP operationally from the buy side, how to do budgets, billing, pacing, etc. Most of these tasks and platforms are pretty similar cross agency, so they figure someone with that experience will need less time to onboard. \n\nThat's the rational answer, but also agreed with all the other comments. Most people agency side don't have a strong programmatic background. Including activation teams. It's a rare find to come across someone who actually understands how a pixel works, let alone SPO. So much of that work isn't done in-house anymore. So they don't have the training/background.",

I used to think supply side vendors were an enigma that didn’t apply to me but when I moved on I realized how much I didn’t understand the ecosystem, and I’m positive now my boss at the time didn’t either. I can tell in intro calls with agencies now a lot of people still feel that way. But it’s not up to you to teach that in an interview. \n\nIn interviews for my current role I was just very clear about my technical knowledge of all platforms and aptitude to picking up platforms quickly.",

I guess it ultimately depends on what the role is and who the hiring manager is. But alot of these skills are transferable which boggles my mind at some hire manger decisions. But they are just going down a check list and not thinking.",
