      "body": "Personally never used that integration before but you'd be looking to see if Activity Name or Activity ID exists in order to filter on the Floodlights you care about in a report. However DV360 only reports on the specific Floodlights you assign to the Line Items, which is only possible via a Order ID report. Unlike CM360 where you can report on any Floodlight regardless of assignment.  \nYour best bet would be to pull that Order ID report separately, schedule it to your inbox, write an appscript to add it to a GSheet every day and ingest that.",
