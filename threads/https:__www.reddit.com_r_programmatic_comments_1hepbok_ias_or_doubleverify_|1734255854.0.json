Go with the solution that offers the best level of transparency and reporting granularity. Realtime reporting that'll allow you to do effective optimisation is another criteria.",

So if you are in between picking a vendor, price point and support team availability is much more important.\n\nJust so you know both of these vendors are not really %100 with non english languages. Its been many occasions some domains labelled as unsafe because mislabeling. \n\nOverall, I would suggest IAS, because it has couple other feautres that you can benefit ( contextual targeting etc). And IAS is much more user friendly. Everytime DV updates their UI, it all goes weird for 3-4 months.",

So my comparison is based on UI and customer service. So far I like IAS better. I find their platform far easier to navigate and easier to train with incoming teams. Their reps are more responsive too. Though in fairness, customer service for both platforms has declined over the years. But that seems to be the case for everything.",

Certain topics would be a bigger issue? How does their custom segment solve)\n\nAdding in measurement (tagging) and/or if you have significant scale of campaigns you might be able to negotiate better rates if you get in touch with them, also if you're interested in anything else they offer to see what deal you get for more features.",

DV's anti-MFA pre-bid is pretty good too, but we use TTD's SP500+ as the base inclusion list. DV's attention product is MRC accredited, IAS is not. IAS is also rumored to be up for sale. I can't say I've had a positive experience with IAS after many years in the industry and they are more expensive. They like to upcharge for every little data feed etc...\n\n  \nAlso scibids is pretty awesome",

I've talked to many pubs from different countries and the feedback is the same: they don't get the needed transparency on why part of their content is not monetisable. IAS/DV always say that 1/ they can't disclose why because pubs would be able to gane the system 2/pubs should pay them to have those information.\n\nAnyway, OP's request is for the demand side, and on that side transparency is limited.\n\nI've had a long discussion with IAS (back in 2021) on sharing granular data in realtime to allow real-time optimisation. They first said that they can do it for an extra cpm but they then changed their mind.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I do believe what IAS and DV offer is needed and is even good for the industry, but they do it in a way that benefits their pockets, not the industry, not advertisers, not pubs, and not us users. It's us who eventually ended up paying for the scandalous margins of IAS/DV.",
