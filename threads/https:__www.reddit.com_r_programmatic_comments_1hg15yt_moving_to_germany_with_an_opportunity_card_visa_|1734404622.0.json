      "body": "I'll share with you my experience but by no means you should base your judgement on it:\n\n1- I love Germany. It's a fantastic country. I speak a bit of German. Yet, it's been a barrier for me to have permanent work there. Most of the people are open minded and nice, but speaking their language is required, especially the importance of the German language has in the country: it's glorified as the language of philosophy.\n\n\n2- In the advertising industry, unlike other industries, speaking German will be considered as mandatory. You gotta speak the language of the country you advertise in. Think Brand Safety, Premium Publishers, etc. Speaking the language is needed for that. Let alone dealing with clients. I had situations where clients simply switched from English to German to deal with the complexity of certain situations.\n\n\n3- Germany has other platforms for recruiting. You should check those. You'll notice that they are all in German. Hence why again speaking the language is critical.\n\n\nHope this gives you a glimpse of what to expect.\nThe few people I know who moved to Germany without speaking the language did so with their partners who spoke the language.",

      "body": "It's a tough but fun language to learn. Don't expect though the same tolerance you might get from native English speakers, who'll always try to understand you and not judge your skills based on how much you master English. Germans, although not the most strict in Europe, will expect you to not only speak very well but also to deeply understand their culture. This is even critical in advertising for the reasons I previously mentioned.\nI'm well exposed to German culture, yet, when it comes to work, I did struggle a bit with some nuances of the German way of doing work.\n\nAs I said, not all industries expect employees to speak German. Finance and science based industries (chemicals, biology, etc.) are organised and ready to have non-german speakers as employees.\n\nTry to visit as a tourist and make up your mind.\nTry to freelance first for German, Austrian and Swiss clients to get a bit of exposure.\n\nWishing you the best for your next adventure!",
