They're definitely double dipping and that's kinda showing up in their antitrust lawsuits. \n\nI'd be happy to talk to you about how my company can help. We have seats at all of the major DSP's.\n\n\nCheers",

      "body": "remember to check for difference between media cost and client cost. In DV360, a partner can add ANY %age additionally to the media cost and jack up the billing to the client (visible in the client cost). Which means that if you are not careful, what you will SAVE from the seat cost, will get billed to you from the jack up the partner will do on the billing. Make sure you take the media cost field from DV360 and compare with client cost field..",
