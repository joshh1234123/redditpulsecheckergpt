      "body": "Depending on the kind of brand you’re selling and if they sell in stores, I would maybe look into retail data if you have a good DSP that has access to that. You can always look at first party data as well. \nWe’ve run a few campaigns for pet stores as well as pet related products. Happy to chat. \nAmazon data is really good for this as well as it’s pulled directly from shopper behavior. \n\nSend me DM. Let’s talk shop",

      "body": "Who do they think the product's target audience is / is there a persona that the creative is trying to appeal to?\n\nPets can be hard to optimize audiences for if you're targeting a general appeal because the saturation rate is high: Nearly half of US households have a dog and more than half have either a dog or a cat. No audience provider is omniscient and there's going to be error (especially in anything \"off the shelf\").\n\nIf you already have \\~50% chance of reaching a dog owner via not targeting at all, there's a good chance that the price of the data will cancel out the benefit of focusing the campaign.\n\nThat being said, location and transaction vendors would be worth considering.\n\nIn my experience CPMs are usually quite low for location vendors, but methodologically, I think InMarket/NinthDecimal is really strong.\n\nStay away from Mastercard or anything that's aggregated at the ZIP code level, it's too expensive for the signal:noise ratio you're going to get.\n\nYou might also have some luck working with survey-based psychographic vendors, like AnalyticsIQ, it's modeled up but if you have a niche audience you're struggling to find, there's a lot more flexibility in this approach that isn't dependent upon a big box giving up its customer data.\n\nGood luck!",

      "body": "Apart from using pin-point accurate data which is great if you can find it, there is another approach to targeting that can be useful in many situations as a fallback. Consider if there is a higher concentration than average of potential customers in certain geographic areas. Surely not everyone living there is a potential customer but if a sufficiently large enough percentage of them are then it could be worth targeting that area and accept the waste. CPM’s for this type of targeting can also be lower than what you get with pin-point targeting.\n\nStart with an idea of how many percent in general of the entire population are potential customers. Say it is 5% just as an example. Then let’s say you can find an area where that percentage is 20%. A lot higher than average. Then scale that into many areas. Maybe narrow it down with some more demographis etc. In your mind, think of a map of the region with some areas marked in red and some areas marked in green. The green ones you want to target. Look for data sources (like public stats databases) with this information (% of households with a pet by location, for example). \n\nThis is not at all intended to be a perfect targeting strategy with 100% accuracy but it will give you a bigger toolbox beyond just perfect data and one an experienced advertiser who understands the limits of only going after pin-point data will maybe buy into.",
