A few ideas here could be users who engaged with product pages but didn't buy, users who have added items to a cart but then didn't purchase (cart abandoners), or specific actions/buttons on the website that would indicate someone is engaged and considering purchasing. All of these tactics could help move users down the funnel. If possible I'd also recommend coupling Retargeting strategies with unique creative messaging to maximize conversion potential - for example, Retargeting cart abandoners with a 20% promo code.",
