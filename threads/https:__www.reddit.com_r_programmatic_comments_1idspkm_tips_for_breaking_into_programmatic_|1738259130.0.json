Generally though, if you can find your interest in any of the 5 pillars -- media planning, audience targeting, campaign execution (including creative dev), reporting, and optimization -- then I think it's a matter of reaching out to some Product Director+ folks at adtech companies on LI to see if they have openings. Without knowing what specifically within adtech you're interested in, it's like wanting a job in the energy sector, way too broad.",

I believe these types of environments allow driven and curious individuals to thrive since they will typically allow you to stretch your role responsibilities. \n\nYou can gain exposure to many facets of a company that you’d otherwise may never experience elsewhere. This is especially helpful for product management since the best product managers in ad tech have an understanding of all aspects of the business: sales, business development, engineering, ad operations, marketing and how all these converge. \n\nEven gaining experience in a non product role will get your foot in the door and upward mobility has less friction. The hardest part is picking the right company.",

Also, the evolving privacy laws have forced AdTech companies to adapt, making it a dynamic and exciting space. I find this shift fascinating and want to contribute to shaping the future of the industry. Plus with my product management experience, I have transferable skills that I believe are highly applicable in adtech.",

People hop across ad tech companies for the money and because it's the easiest interview to get. in my 10 years experience of the hundreds of people I've met, I know maybe 10 who have left and not come back.\n\nit's also kind of like working for the matrix if not for an advertiser directly or some vendors. you buy into that people and behavior become numbers on a screen. I think you're encouraged to believe programmatic has a larger share of voice in influencing behavior than it actually does.\n\npeople join for money and to solve interesting problems but it can be soul sucking.\n\nthat said if you don't care about that, apply at a platform for better wlb, not an agency. engage with people on linkedin or networking events. get certified in as many dsps as you can to enhance your resume. dv360 cert is free and theres other good courses on skillshop. stay up to date on news via digiday, adexchanger, ad age, the current. understand ctv, audio, and dooh as emerging channels and also how id matching works and the biggest id players in the cookieless future. understand the life of an ad call and the logic of winning a valuable impression. retail media is another worm hole you could specialize in.\n\nit's a whole universe behind a computer screen.",
