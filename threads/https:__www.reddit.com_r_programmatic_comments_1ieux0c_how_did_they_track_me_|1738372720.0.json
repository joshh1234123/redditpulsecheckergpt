This: \n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a418880](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a418880)\n\n3) Said company made an audience defined as \"users that did X or why on my site\"\n\n4) You did \"x or y\" in their site, the L.I. pixel looks at all records from the Vendor website collected through their pixel that matches the definition and creates a group of actionable IDs matching said definition\n\n5) The Vendor buys the following service from LinkedIn - and activates InMail from the audience definition above:\n\n[https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/message-ads](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/message-ads)\n\n6) Voila! You get a \"prospect followup\" email and feel creeped out :)\n\n  \nHope this helps",
