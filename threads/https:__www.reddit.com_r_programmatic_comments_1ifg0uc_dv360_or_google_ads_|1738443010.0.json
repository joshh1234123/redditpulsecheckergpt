      "body": "With DV360, you get access to premium YouTube inventory, like ***YouTube Select*** which is the top 5% of YouTube content, categorized into relevant lineups (e.g., Entertainment, Sports, Beauty). Think of it as the \"best of the best\" on YouTube and this is not accessible via Google Ads. You also get access to YT Programmatic Guaranteed deals, Instant Reserve and YouTube TV (YT TV is currently only in the US). YT falls under non-exchange and the tech fee is much lower compared to the open exchange fee. Since you have a 7 figure ad spend, I think you can leverage it to secure favourable rates. I think the fee is worth it and you get full transparency on actual ad spend and partner fees. If you're looking at a partner-level seat in North America, I can recommend the Google partner our team is working with",

Otherwise if we’re talking about Youtube-only, no need for DV360. Google Ads has no fee and has a better UI for setup and optimization.",
