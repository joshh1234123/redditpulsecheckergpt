      "body": "You're fine homie. People keep neglecting to mention that automation is just a lever that multiplies human work. If there's no humans involved, then no actual work gets done at all. The belief that \"AI can do it all\" has proven to be a total failure in every single test. You need a human to \"steer it around.\" It is absolutely effective when used that way, it does increase the amount of work an average human can accomplish in a given time frame as it is reducing the amount of time it takes to do many tasks.\n\nThe people that don't think that you need humans involved in the process are just scamtech companies selling people AI slop as a product.",

As a few others have said in this thread, human supervision will continue to be needed to steer the ship, translate optimizations, and make strategic, big-picture decisions. While I do think AI will continue to advance and change the industry, the best approach we all can take as we head into this era is lean into AI and use it to our benefit. Use it as an edge to other professionals in the industry - there are a lot of exciting ways that AI tools can already be used today to make people more effective and efficient in their roles.",

So, it takes half as much effort to create a competitor as well. So, what's going to end up happening here with AI, the new startup companies are going to be able to operate at much lower cost levels. There's going to be a massive corporate transition.\n\n>not to mention the productivity gains with intermediary tooling can approach 10x and more.\n\nWell, I think it's really silly that software developers are focusing on tasks that humans can do when they should be focusing on tasks that are not possible with out AI. You know that's what I am personally trying to do with my business, but I understand everyone's urge to create a product that is effectively just selling people AI slop.",
