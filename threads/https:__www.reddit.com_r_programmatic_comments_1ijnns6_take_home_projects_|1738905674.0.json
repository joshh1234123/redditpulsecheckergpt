If so, you maybe closer than you think to being hired and could be used as a way to distinguish whose the better fit. \n\nI know its a huge pain. Just be sure its a legit place. \n\nMy guess is they have been burned by someone that was hired and lied about their experience. Either way, those take home projects now are kind of BS with AI and all the tools available. \n\nMy best answer would be to try and reuse something you already have and remove and client names.",
