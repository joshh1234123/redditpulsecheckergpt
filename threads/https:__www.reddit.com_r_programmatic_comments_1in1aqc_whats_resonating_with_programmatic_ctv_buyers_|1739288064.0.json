      "body": "Fraud and IVT are critical concerns. The key question is: Are you clean by your own standards or by agency standards? If you’re using major vendors like Human, IAS, DV, or Pixalate, do they all confirm that your traffic is clean? There’s no single source of truth when proving legitimacy to buyers.\n\nSecond, have you tested how your inventory appears in a DSP? For example, what happens when buying through a DV360 seat? Are there any issues or inconsistencies?\n\nThird, when buying your own inventory, do you see a significant CPM gap that might indicate value loss or capture issues?\n\nFourth, have you analyzed your bid request parameters? Tweaking certain values could potentially increase bid activity or CPM.\n\nThese are just a few areas worth investigating, but they offer a solid starting point.",
