      "body": "Seeing the floodlights isn't the guarantee that the linking is complete unfortunately. Like Mitchell suggested, best way to ensure the linking is clear is by typing the placement ID, if nothing returned something is incomplete.\n\nSo let's review a few key steps & let us know if you proceeded as followed:  \n\\-Floodlight configuration from CM should have been shared with DV  \n\\-A new  advertiser to receive those floodlights should be created in DV  \n\\-The new advertiser should be set-up with the parameter \"ad-server\" targeted to CM\n\nThose might sound like basics, but always worth checking the baseline is clean.\n\nThen, let's keep in mind that the actual syncing can take a few hours, from my experience its between a couple hours and 6 hours (though some connections take longer)\n\nThen, are you adding the tracking at a line item or creative level? Are you seeing anything in the drop down menu? And like you said, pasting the right placement ID isn't working right? /!\\\\ Let's make sure we are talking about the PLACEMENT ID from CM and not something else\n\nAnd regarding this placement ID, do you confirm that in your CM campaign, you have created placements & checked the Placement Properties / Placement type part that is set for DV360 & programmatic campaigns?\n\nThat should give us enough clues before moving forward",
