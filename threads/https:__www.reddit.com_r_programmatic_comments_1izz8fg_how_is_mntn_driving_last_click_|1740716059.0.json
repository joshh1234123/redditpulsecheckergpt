I can drop the PDF somewhere and PM it to you, but in it, it says:\n\n* **Measure True Performance With Cross-Device Verified Visits** Once your ad is served, Cross-Device Verified Visits tracks the viewers’ IP address and device IDs. If those IDs visit your website—in a window of time defined by you—it counts as a visit both in Performance TV’s reporting and Google Analytics. That means once a user completes an ad, it allows you to tie visits, conversions, and other key metrics to your campaign— giving you total insight into direct-response performance.\n* **Full Google Analytics Integration** It’s important to track and verify your performance from non- clickable Connected TV inventory, which is why Cross-Device Verified Visits is fully integrated into Google Analytics. We create a real-time map of all devices within a household that touched your website or campaigns, and send it to Google Analytics to ensure proper attribution using the Google Analytics Measurement Protocol API.\n\nSo I think this is what you're seeing, since there's no way to click a CTV ad.  And since they mainly do retargeting, they're obviously going to drop your ad in front of people who will convert anyways, so the impressions may be largely non-incrememental.",
