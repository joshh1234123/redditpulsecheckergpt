Open a ticket with Google and they should be able to tell you pretty quickly. \n\nAre you in the middle of troubleshooting and need an answer now, or is this for a hypothetical scenario that may come up? If you’re troubleshooting currently, then the publisher should be able to pull a bid response where you can check which vast version was sent",

So if a pub didn’t declare it right like saying it allows up to VAST 4 but in reality they can do VAST 2 only, then DV360 will send the creative in VAST 4 which won’t work.\n\nNot sure if CM allows you to select what VAST version during sync but it’s definitely an option if you export the tag.",
