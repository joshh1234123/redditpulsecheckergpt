      "body": "In my experience, when the cpms are too good to be true, it's because you actually aren't buying the inventory you think you are. That dream cpm is achieved with audience extension and fraud.\n\n\nTheir performance CTV gimmick is a complete scam. You yourself don't trust their ROAS metric. Why then, would you trust the low cpms they offer you? Being cheaper than direct should be a giant red flag.\n\n\nIf you're cool with buying dog shit, just want to deliver on campaigns, and don't care about spending the advertiser's budget wisely, MNTN sounds awesome. Otherwise I would stay away!",
