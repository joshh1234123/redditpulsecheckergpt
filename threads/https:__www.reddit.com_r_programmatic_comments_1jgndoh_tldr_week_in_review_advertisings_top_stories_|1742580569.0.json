It's a great initiative and it's great to see them partnering with Prebid.org.\n\nI don't understand the criticism they are getting. Some people in adtech just got used to criticise pretty much everything even when there's no threat to their business or their ego (but maybe to their podcasts).\n\nTech Lab's solution might not address all the challenges for now, but it's a first step on the right direction to allow the industry have a credible and a genuinely collaborative alternative to what the walled cesspits or the not-so open source IDs offer.\n\nThe roadmap looks good, so my wish we all go shinkansen with it.",
