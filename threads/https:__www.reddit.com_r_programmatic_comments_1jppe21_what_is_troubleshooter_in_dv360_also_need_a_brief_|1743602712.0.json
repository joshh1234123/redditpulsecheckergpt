It helps you figure out what’s blocking impressions, it could be budget pacing, targeting issues, or even creative approvals. It's super useful when something looks off.\n* **Prebid** is all about making sure your bid actually has a shot before it enters the auction. It helps optimize bids based on floor prices, past performance, etc., so you’re not just throwing money away.\n* **Targeting** is where you set up who sees your ads. Think audiences, geo, device, all that good stuff.\n* **Creatives** are the actual ads (banners, video, native, etc.) you’re running.\n* **Audiences** are the groups of people you’re targeting. You can use first-party data, Google’s audience segments, or even third-party data providers.\n\nHope that helps! DV360 is solid once you get a feel for it. Lmk if you have any questions.",
