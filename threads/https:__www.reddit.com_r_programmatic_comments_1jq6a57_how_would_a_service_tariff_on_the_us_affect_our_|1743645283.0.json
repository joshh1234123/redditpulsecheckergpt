Not entirely sure how they are implemented today but I think the case used to be at least that the customer would be required to deduct the service tariff from the invoice amount before sending payment to the supplier. So if you invoice 100 USD to a customer in Brazil for your services and the tariff is 20 USD you would get paid 80.",

      "body": "Not sure! If countries are placing or enlarging tariffs on our services then it would be a hit to US companies bottom line and they’d probably want to reduce costs elsewhere. I asked ChatGPT on how this could affect the industry and here’s what it said:\n\n1. Withholding Taxes on Cross-Border Ad Spend\n\nIf countries impose withholding taxes on payments to foreign ad platforms:\n\t•\tA brand in Brazil buying programmatic ads through a U.S.-based DSP might have 10–15% of its payment withheld.\n\t•\tThis increases costs for buyers and may shift demand toward local or in-country ad platforms.\n\nImpact: Foreign DSPs become less competitive; brands may prefer domestic platforms to avoid extra tax burdens.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Data Localization Requirements\n\nMany countries (e.g. India, China, Russia) require data about local users to be stored or processed within their borders:\n\t•\tThis increases infrastructure costs for global ad tech firms.\n\t•\tIt also limits the ability to centralize audience targeting, analytics, or optimization algorithms.\n\nImpact: Less efficient campaigns, higher operating costs, and difficulty in maintaining global product parity.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Market Access Barriers\n\nSome countries could:\n\t•\tRequire ad tech firms to register locally, share code or IP, or form joint ventures.\n\t•\tRestrict certain types of data-driven targeting for foreign platforms (e.g., political or behavioral ads).\n\nImpact: Global expansion becomes more complicated; smaller ad tech companies may not have the resources to comply and exit markets altogether.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Government Preference for Domestic Providers\n\nGovernments might:\n\t•\tMandate that public sector ad buying go through nationally based DSPs or SSPs.\n\t•\tImpose certifications that favor local vendors.\n\nImpact: International players lose access to public sector budgets or face longer sales cycles.\n\n⸻\n\n5. Pressure to Repatriate Revenue or Pay Digital Services Taxes\n\nSeveral countries have implemented digital services taxes (DSTs) targeting revenues from foreign digital companies (e.g., France’s 3% DST on digital advertising revenue from large platforms).\n\nImpact: Even if not called a “tariff,” these taxes function similarly—eating into margins and creating accounting complexity.\n\n⸻\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf countries impose tariff-like rules on services:\n\t•\tGlobal ad tech becomes more balkanized—with fragmentation of data, tech, and access.\n\t•\tCross-border efficiency suffers, especially for targeting, optimization, and measurement.\n\t•\tCompliance and legal overhead rise, favoring the biggest players (Google, Meta, Amazon) who can afford to adapt",

      "body": "There will be tons of layoffs, but ad spend will go down with it.  Marketing actually makes sense to be the first to go, especially for big brands.  If every big brand in a sector cuts marketing by 50%, then it's even Steven for all players.   Kind of mutualy agreed money saving while sales will stay relatively the same as a percentage of market share.  I don't think we'll see a 50% drop, but I'd say somewhere in the 15-25% range is probable.  This will be the weakest economy we have seen in our lifetime and that's not even taking into account the unrest that's going to happen globally.",

I agree that the currently levied tariffs are on goods, but there’s rumors circulating that service tariffs will be placed on the US as a result, and since we’re such a heavily service based economy, that would likely affect our industry (as it is a service based industry).
