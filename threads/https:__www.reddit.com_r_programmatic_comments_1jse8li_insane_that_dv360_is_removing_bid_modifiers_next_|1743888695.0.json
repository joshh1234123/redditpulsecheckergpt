      "body": "I’m convinced they’re trying to make this platform as dumbed down, tedious, and feature-lacking as possible. I cannot express how much I absolutely despise DV360… everything from the UI, the campaign structuring, the reporting, the (lack of) support teams, their mind numbingly useless Help Center… I could write a short novel about my hate for this platform. It’s the epitome of ”set it and forget it”, but in all the worst ways. \n\nI would’ve thought during the last… idk… 5-10 years? That they would’ve felt the pressure from the likes of TTD to try to modernize their platform and capabilities. But no. They’re Google and they know they can trim out features piece by piece without a problem because DV/CM are so integral to so many agencies. \n\n  \nAt this point the only reason we even keep DV360 onboard is for YouTube, and Google still tries to screw you with that by sneaking in open web video inventory by default. Like come on. \n\n  \nIt’s been years since the release of video demand gen campaigns and we still get random google reps reaching out to pitch it.  Like they’re still toting “new” features that are multiple years old. \n\n  \nFuck I hate DV360.",
