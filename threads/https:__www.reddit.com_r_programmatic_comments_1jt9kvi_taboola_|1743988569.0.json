      "body": "Click bait serves a purpose. Native is good for storytelling, and for giving your customers the why. A display ad will show your logo, and the product (if you are selling something) and maybe have your catchphrase. Which is fine when all you need to do to generate sales is say something like “just do it” or coke is it.”\n\nBut when your offering needs people to understand why it’s valuable to them, native gives you the room to explain that. Native forces you to include copy with your image, and most native doesn’t want your logo. So the copy has to convince the customer to click and learn more..and thats the other part of native that people miss. It used to be content discovery, and thats still where its value is. Pay off what the copy says in the page it clicks through to. Continue to build up the why before you ask the consumer for a form fill or a purchase. \n\nDm me if you wanna chat. I used to work at outbrain. Taboola and out brain are the coke and pepsi of native",

They have high levels of familiarity because their ad units are on many pub sites that real people actually see, but also the ads are mostly not good.\n\nWhat stands out are the low quality placements, but that's a sign of high supply vs demand. I see a good amount of \"legit\" ads when I take the time to look, but I have a feeling that they're actually frequency capping and then the rest gets filled with CPC?\n\nThere's a tendency to confuse the quality of the ads with the value of the channel.\n\nI'd say the most interesting things to know are their relationships with Microsoft and Yahoo!:\n\n[Taboola Reaches 10 Years in Serving Advertising on Microsoft Properties Including MSN, Edge Browsers and Windows Experiences; Taboola Now Serves Advertising Across Microsoft Productivity Suite, Including Outlook Mail and Office 365 | Taboola.com](https://www.taboola.com/press-release/microsoft-10years)\n\n[Yahoo Properties Worldwide are Now Available through Taboola; Advertisers Now Have Unrivaled Reach Through One Platform | Taboola.com](https://www.taboola.com/press-release/yahoo-properties-worldwide)\n\nBut they have exclusive agreements with tons of publishers around the globe.\n\n  \nAlso, they recently revealed a new offering called Realize that hangs a lampshade on their reputation for only doing chumbox ads and seems to be a more omnichannel performance marketing platform that leverages their data to optimize towards outcomes: [Taboola Expands Beyond Native Ads with Realize; New Technology Platform Allows Taboola to Serve The Entire Performance Advertising Market, Customers Include Babbel, eToro and More | Taboola.com](https://www.taboola.com/press-release/taboola-realize)\n\n  \nTheir data footprint is really good (especially post-Connexity acquisition which also got them Skimlinks); their theoretical position post-cookies is above average thanks to their publisher install base, and they're clearly articulating a more mature direction (they've also been announcing a lot of MFA and brand safety partnerships to try and address those concerns about the format).\n\nLOL I swear I don't work for Taboola",

In other words, if I hear in conversation with a potential customer that they cannot be successful with the platform (in my opinion and based on the offer, the target values, the journey, the tracking) then I let the person know.\n\nI can assure you that there are definitely products that work very well with Taboola and our Ads Manager realize and are scalable.\n\n**Here is a list of the mistakes I usually see in accounts that speak badly of the platform:** \n\n\\- the campaigns were ended too early  \n\\- too fast intervention in the campaigns  \n\\- too narrow audience settings  \n\\- too niche product  \n\\- too low budget  \n\\- too many/too few assets  \n\\- bad or inappropriate offer (best to have an offer for older people)  \n\\- no or faulty tracking  \n\\- start without blocklist or with traffic from pages that do not work for the vertical  \n\\- no advertorial -> traffic directly to product or in form   \n\\- constant violations of the policy (because -> too lazy to read policy)\n\nI do not want to say that it is never due to the platform that a project is not ideal. But in my experience and looking at hundreds of accounts, in 95% of the cases it is rather the suboptimal use, the mediabuying or another point that leads to failure.\n\nIf you have any questions (including very detailed ones), please get in touch. **I don't want to sell you anything!**",
