      "body": "There are issues with the ecosystem, I do think the percentages of spend is impacting some of these high percentages of 'tech tax' because of a few variables these tech platforms are trying to offset their costs.\n\n1 - race to the bottom CPMs, some advertising is still driving cheap impressions, for tech platforms to make a reasonable fee on a $1cpm the % needs to be higher.\n\n2 -lower cost market expansion, similar to above but a little different in global economies, you've built a platform on USA costs but to grow you need to expand globally, but emerging markets have cheaper media when netting back to USD, even if they buy premium inventory in that market maybe that's a $2 CPM you now need high % to offset your USD costs.\n\nPart of the issue is the higher CPM clients are shouldering higher % to offset cheaper clients/markets. \n\nAd tech as a percentage is to entrenched in the system, but so has been low CPMs (although this is shifting somewhat there is still a lot of scale in cheap media) so I don't know which one needs to give.\n\nI don't have any solutions, just felt like having a rant about this issue as I think the economy of the percentage tax to low media costs is at odds but rarely talked about.",
