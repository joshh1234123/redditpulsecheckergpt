To often I work with clients who look at it in silo (no matter how many times you tell them not to)...to this day I still work with clients who think CTR is an actual metric that matters and they compare it across different tactics...you simply can't. \n\nIt can and certainly is utilized for conversion, but for most brands they're not going to see better conversion rates out of programmatic than they do in other channels (social, search, email)...The concept of programmatic as a whole has been wildly over sold....\"I can reach the exact person I want at the right time I want cause I have all this rich data\".....The problem is most of the data brands have access to is highly misclassified and the environment that people are being exposed to, the content isn't usually an environment where the consumer is actively ready to buy, it's a prospect environment (when you're using an audience based approach). \n\nLeveraging 1st party data is one exception because the user you're engaging should already be familiar with your brand. Your goal is to then find them across the web where they are, instead of waiting for them to come to you (search). \n\n  \nB2B is a good example of this...several years ago this term coined ABM (account based marketing), got funneled into programmatic (somehow)....so you had legacy Account marketers who are used to leveraging highly niche/targeted marketing programs mostly delivered across email marketing...ABM in programmatic terms needs to be a funnel feeder to your tried and true ABM tactics, because if you stay niche in targeting, you can't scale. Some marketers have latched onto the concept of \"buying groups\", which targets individuals included in a buying journey, versus the end game person who signs a contract. In this concept, buying groups are great to reach across programmatic, because you're trying to build awareness for your brand so they influence the end buyer....if you go into programmatic trying to reach only the end buyer, you'll be disappointed in your results.",

      "body": "B2B advertisers are behind in their adoption of programmatic. The main barrier to programmatic for B2B advertisers has been targeting and scale - limited data signals to find niche B2B audiences and difficulty to scale up. So programmatic is better suited to B2C advertisers.  \n  \nProgrammatic is a way of buying media. As such, it is not a media channel, but a way to transact and it can be used for different goals: awareness and conversion. In fact, online display programmatic campaigns typically have two components: prospecting and retargeting tactics, where prospecting looks for new audiences (new prospects) and retargeting targets users who have been to advertiser's website (so audiences actively in-market). In programmatic campaigns, retargeting tactics deliver higher conversion rates than prospecting campaigns, understandably.",

In theory, any vertical *can* use it and any goal *can* be supported. Even though it's technically flexible, we still see that some types of businesses embrace it more than others and some goals (like awareness) seem to be more common than, for example conversion. I'm trying to understand why this is? For example:  \n  \n\\- Do some companies have characteristics (like rich first-party data, or complex customer journeys) that make programmatic more *effective*?  \n\\- Are there certain misconceptions or practical barriers that stop smaller or more traditional companies from using it?",

The problem is you have players in the space like Bombora who go out there pitching the concept that they can reach these Job titles and specific organizations and the reality is that their solution is simply behavior based and that doesn't translate well to B2B.\n\nIn consumer if I'm looking at airline travel, I'm responsible for actually purchasing that, so the sales cycle is closer to the decision maker....in B2B if I'm looking at context related to ERP, I could be a junior employee learning about the industry and I work in a fortune 1000 company so there is a huge process through to the actually buyer...so continuing to hit me up hoping I turn into a lead is stretch.",

      "body": "Thanks for your input, really helpful!\n\nTotally agree that B2B is still lagging behind in programmatic adoption. The combination of limited audience signals and niche targeting makes scale a real challenge. I’ve also noticed that many B2B marketers are still more comfortable with email and search — channels where targeting is more direct and outcomes feel more measurable.\n\nThe distinction you made between prospecting vs. retargeting is also super relevant. Prospecting seems great for awareness, but comes with lower CTRs and conversion rates — which some clients don’t fully expect or accept.\n\nOne thing I’m wondering:  \nIn your experience, have you seen certain B2B niches or verticals where programmatic *does* work well? Or does it mostly make sense when paired with a strong retargeting or ABM strategy?  \nAnd  \nif B2C is such a better fit because of broader audiences, more data signals, and a simpler conversion path. Is trying to push programmatic in B2B even worth it for most brands? Or should it only be considered when there's already a strong base (like solid CRM data or a long-term content strategy)?\n\nWould love to learn more from your experience!",

      "body": "You’re right, some do embrace it more. \n\nI would suggest some types of businesses are more likely to adopt the type of metrics that are more sympathetic to programmatic - businesses with direct transactions online. In fact, I’d argue the higher % of total sales done online, the more likely the business is to prioritise programmatic. Translating online signals into media buying signals can be automated, even if they do not drive incrementally - for example CTR. \n\nYour second question is interesting, and i think misconceptions about success metrics might prevent smaller brands from trying it. Being able to measure properly might be a problem, but then googles free MMM might be a solution for that. ",

Leveraging 1st party data for look-a-likes is an option as well, but I wouldn't necessarily buy into platform based look-a-likes (especially anything B2B related or even consumer beyond basic things like retail or CPG)...there are too many nuances to purchasing that should be modeled from offline data.  \n\n\"Scale\" was always a term with some validity when 3rd party cookies were the standard...but there are solutions now that don't rely on 3rd party cookies and can help brands reach what would otherwise be deemed small audiences in the past. \n\nYou certainly need the right tools or partners to activate that data effectively. The \"gold\" standard in 1st party onboarding has always been LiveRamp, but that's not usually an option for small brands because they cost a ton of money and to my knowledge (maybe its changed) they require minimum list sizes, because on the backend, their really just matching to cookie IDs even though they'll throw fancy industry lingo at you.",

Or does it mostly make sense when paired with a strong retargeting or ABM strategy?\n\nIf by \"work\" you mean generating leads, no, not really. Programmatic could still be relevant for brand awareness within B2B audiences. As per u/[OrdinaryInside8](https://www.reddit.com/user/OrdinaryInside8/) comment in this thread, programmatic in B2B often targets behaviors rather than job titles, which means you might reach individuals who aren’t decision-makers—like junior employees. Still, building brand awareness among them can be valuable, as they may become future buyers as they progress in their careers. This might be particularly true in some industries or professions. For instance, consider an industry where precision and accuracy are critical, such as pharma manufacturing or clinical instrumentation. In these cases, establishing a brand known for those qualities can offer long-term advantages.\n\n>if B2C is such a better fit because of broader audiences, more data signals, and a simpler conversion path.

Or should it only be considered when there's already a strong base (like solid CRM data or a long-term content strategy)?\n\nAs per the above - brand awareness can be important for B2B brands, so programmatic should be considered. B2B companies need brand awareness just as much as B2C, yet this is often overlooked, with B2B marketing frequently reduced to mere lead generation.",
