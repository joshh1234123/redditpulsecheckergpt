Stability, safety, opportunities to grow etc. If you jump on a job with a high salary but you have to leave after1 year that might be worse than a slightly less paying job that you can keep and grow from for 5-10 years. So assess opportunities not by salary alone.",

      "body": "Not necessarily. A major misconception in this industry is that agency side always pays less than any other side of the industry. There’s ample data proving that to be false. I have seen numerous job listings of ad tech companies and some DSPs and SSPs for which the salary range was pretty comparable to what you could get at an agency for less years of experience. I even once interviewed at a ad tech data vendor company for a senior role and their salary range was pure garbage for the amount of experience they asked for. I made more money as a senior associate at a hold co.\n\nI know everyone talks about getting out of agency for any other side but I think that the idea of it is a bit over glorified. Having worked on both sides, I’d say the work life balance hasn’t been bad on the agency side and the people who I work with have been pleasant to work with.\n\nBut generally, if you go to the top and well-known DSPs, you will probably be paid well, but that’s not necessarily true for the lower level DSPs. Those DSPs don’t necessarily pay well",

I’ve seen CSM’s do better at agency than other places. It’s a million factors that go into it. \n\nMight be helpful to know what kind of role you’re thinking about and how you want comp to come. Some ppl don’t mind going to a tech company to get yearly comp but others need to go on a quarterly bonus structure. It all sort of depends on",
