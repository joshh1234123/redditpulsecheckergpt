For new products there is nothing better than TV. The problem is it’s hard to test, platforms are SO sketchy with massive (usually undisclosed) take rates and firms like “scientific” or “neon” or “mount” etc. all sell the same long tail 2% of viewership while claiming only their competition does. I’m working on a solve but display (or worse) RT is NOT an alternative to TV. It’s that **TV media buying needs alternatives**",
