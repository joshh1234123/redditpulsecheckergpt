      "body": "Worked in both previously. Indie agencies tend to have smaller clients but the relationship is much more cozy compared to the big agencies.\n\nThe big agencies care about scope vs. $$, the pro's and con's are both present, while I don't disagree with the principle of you won't get what you didn't pay for.\n\nBut for the employees, when you're in an indie agency, client's didn't pay for Analytics work, but by gaining access, the employee gets to learn so much more beyond just the surface level metrics.\n\n  \nJudging by the circle I was exposed to, regardless of agencies large or small, it seems almost everyone aspires to leave the agency scene, the general rule of thumb applies is the lower the margin, the easier you win clients principle applies. Which translates to account manager to client ratio to get out of hand and employees are at most times overworked.\n\nHaving the experience of an indie agency, then later in large agencies, it truly felt that the \"We're so big\" attitude commonly seen in large agencies, you just feel..... dare i say they're so shit, never touched this, never tried that, zero experience with such and such, because their contracted scope just do not cover the skill and they could just look good because of the logo, but skillset wise, they do suck.\n\nBut, when employers hire, they do look for the big logo to hire, so the logo helps with leaving the scene, but to learn real skills and experience, definitely indie.",

      "body": "I come from a big agency and after years I can compare it to a political party.\nThere's a lot of internal sectorization (you either do A or B), so you'll be basically focused on your main role and not expand beyond it. \nToo much focus on money/increasing revenue (worked with margins up to 50%), which obviously won't reflect on your paycheck even though we're kinda forced to bring more money to the company.\nWay too many commitments with publishers, partners and platforms, like in a given year you need to spend $X with Google, $Y with Netflix, $Z with a random media partner that came out from nowhere just because. The outcome is that you're forced to constantly shift money and rebuild campaigns due to these commitments that change along the way.\n\nGood if you're more into getting your job done and chill, or be exposed to top of mind clients and partners. \n\n-----\n\nAlso had an experience with a smaller agency, where I learned a lot due to focus on more tasks at once. \nSmaller budgets > Less money > Lots of manual work (bad & low cost platforms, no ad servers, that Analytics guy who used to maintain the dashboards up to date now left and you now need to f** yourself managing data manually to understand what's happening before that client presentation).\nUsually charges clients by hours worked on their account.\nMore humanely-focused on client relationships, but I worked in an area where I noticed that many campaigns were literally a joke in terms of brand safety, MAF websites, bots etc. This doesn't happen in big agencies due to teams that build blocklists etc.\n\nGood if you're more into building closer relationships with clients and gaining experience on more fields/collaborative work. It might be also a headache.",
