      "body": "This is from a TTD perspective. \n\n1. Accept you likely won't see incremental lift and think about your next step if that happens (more on this below) \n\n2. Try to ensure you're not running concurrent activity in the platform that *isn't* part of the test/holdout groups or you'll risk contamination muddying results. This also goes for activity outside of the platform which you don't really have control over. If your results are not significant, see to what extent contamination may have occurred \n\n3. Ensure your audience targeting cross device methodology matches your conversion lift methodology (TTD will always use an XD graph for your testing/holdout conversion attribution). I.e. if using person cross device for your lift experiment, use person cross device for your audience targeting \n\n4. If your raw data shows 'negative' lift - ignore it and treat it as no lift detected. TTD uses a one sided t-test, it's not testing for negative lift \n\n5.  You'll need to select a primary conversion event, but if you have literally ANY other conversion point then add them to your campaign (i.e. site visits, site behaviour events...). TTD will measure lift against all conversion events applied to a campaign. This way if you don't detect lift on your primary event, at least there may be other indicators of behaviour lift \n\n6. If you do not drive overall lift, look into the data to see if there were any pockets that did see significance. TTD measure lift at an overall test/holdout level, campaign level, ad group level and device level. NOTE: Any insights here should be treated as *directional*. The reason being that there will be overlap between these dimensions, i.e. a person could be in campaign A and campaign B so these insights won't be entirely clean. As you'll get results weekly, you can optimise your campaign based on these results. \n\n7. If you do see insights like the above, you can verify this by running further testing in the form of **multi-cell tests**. TTD's multi-cell experiments allow you to have more than one test/holdout group where no single person can be in more than one cell. Meaning you can cleanly test for specific hypotheses (i.e. does campaign A drive more lift than campaign B?) \n\n8. TTD won't deem any lift as 'significant' unless it has a p-value below 0.1 (90% confidence) and is above the minimum detectable lift. If you want to be more lenient in your confidence levels you can increase this to whatever you want, for example an 80% confidence level by accepting lift with a p-value of 0.2. Google for example will report on a hierarchy of confidence levels, where as TTD will give 'significant or not significant' \n\n9. Make sure your campaign is set up in a way you'll most likely drive lift, this is usually in the form of quality delivery. I.e. prioritise viewability, above the fold, completion rate, pre-roll, non-crappy sites etc...\n\n10. Make sure your exclusions are as robust as you can POSSIBLY make them. Exclude all previous converters from your conversion events, but also push through CRM data to further bolster this exclusion \n\n11. Work with your TTD reps to get frequent data reports. They are generated weekly but currently aren't accessible through the UI/reporting so they can send them to you.",

You'll have to get into the exclusion game to make sure you're not targeting people who already converted. \n\nIf it's something like a repeatable purchase, different story.\n\nEdit: Be sure you're de-duplicating the conversions via adserver/similar stuff to match the ones from the DSP to the ones on the clients side",
