I’m so sick of reps asking for time or asking me to tell them what I need help with. No, do your homework and you tell me, you should have access to sellervrowd and at the very least know my brands. I don’t have 30 minutes to waste letting you ask leading questions so you can look good to your boss in sales force for getting a meeting, quite literally not my job. Provide value up front in terms of how you can help me or politely leave me alone. Also this is probably an unpopular opinion but to me like, wtf is this “you can put time on my calendar” calend.ly link thing. I hate that, you work around my time and I’ll let you know when I’m available, you send and own the invite as the rep, one less thing for me to do.",
