Overall I'd say a wash at this point, but it's getting better and I would've said a step back 6 months ago. Was clearly released before it was finished.\n\nPeriodic table is ???? They made it more difficult to make bulk changes, more difficult to see certain metrics on certain pages, still can't see certain things at all like individual native creative details.\n\nBut they've added some great stuff. Ad refresh, ad load, more media type placement details, seeing avg competitive bids, QA feature. overall more powerful, less intuitive i'd probably say.\n\nSolimar update was good and Kokai still has a ways to go, but I actually think with some more time in the oven it can be really good. But the periodic table specifically is quite literally the worst part of the entire update and partially overshadows the good stuff.\n\nif they would let you add shortcuts from the periodic table to the sidebar that alone would be a drastic improvement.",
