That’s a pretty standard experience of how they operate. If they assure you of something, you may find out months later it’s wrong. Table stakes measurement confuses them like it’s rocket science. 🤮",

      "body": "You're better off using an agency reseller of tier 1 DSP like TTD or DV360 rather than muddle around with the tier 2/3 ones unless you really want to experiment.\n\nThe truth is programmatic does much better when Google and meta are really firing as they will be your primary prospecting channels until they're maxed out.\n\nUnless you're deep into six figure budgets for meta, google, organic, etc you'll struggle to spend more than $10-20K\n\nAnother little tip is that the mix of retargeting/prospecting is a lot more apparent compared to meta and Google which also rely on retargeting but the percentage of each can be difficult to sus when you're running conversion campaigns.\n\nI usually tell people you can spend approximately $1000 on display retargeting per 10,000 monthly site users and it works better the more overall traffic you have.\n\nThen you layer in native, pre roll, etc.\n\nWe started with a reseller before we went direct, if you need need a referral let me know.",

If you need to dabble past that, native like taboola and outbrain function like dsps but within the walled gardens of their own inventory.
