      "body": "**Pros:** \n\n1. Audience targeting is really good. You can use the omnichannel ID graph to map to DOOH screens, too, and index based on the users in the graph.\n\n2. Very similar capabilities to the likes of Vistar in terms of inventory access and targeting based on things like screen owner, venue type, dayparting, location, and even weather. There's also a DOOH Planner tool that allows you to filter to specific screens and submit a deal request through the tool.\n\n  \n**Cons**\n\n1. Deal set up can be a bit manual, because it varies by which screens/placements you want. If you have a bunch of different SSPs/screen owners in a deal, it can be a little more legwork.\n\n2. Targeting doesn't have the same specificity as other channels like display and video. Things like f-capping, auction type, etc. aren't supported. (This isn't specific to Yahoo DSP, but not sure how much that's a consideration for you.)\n\nFair note: I work at Yahoo DSP and have covered off on our DOOH capes for a few years.",

      "body": "Pros: they sit on a variety of inventory sources, so they aren’t limited to one partner. \n\nCons: you’ll pay more than going directly to someone like Vistar. Vistar has a really nice forecasting visual that clients love. I believe StackAdapt is built on top of this visual (or it looks pretty identical). I personally think Yahoo is clunky and don’t really see them as an industry leader. \n\nJust curious - Who else have you demoed for this shift? Why the shift in DOOH DSP?",
