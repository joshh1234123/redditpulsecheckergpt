      "body": "This is very interesting, thanks for sharing. I have a couple questions:\n\n1. How are you measuring/targeting (if applicable) the refresh count?\n2. Are you controlling for time? Obviously refresh count will closely correlate with time, but the difference in time for X refreshes becomes more and more significant as time increases. A publisher refreshing every 15 seconds will hit 20 refreshes after 5 minutes, while refreshing after 30s would take 10 minutes for the same count.",

      "body": "Yes, post-refresh impressions are typically sold at lower prices. However, in most standard CPC campaigns, directly targeting refresh vs. non-refresh impressions isn’t usually available as a standard targeting option.  \nThat said, there are workarounds. If you're working with specific publishers or SSPs, setting up a PMP deal where the publisher passes a custom signal indicating whether an impression is a refresh is possible. This way, you can segment and optimize your buying.",

We usually see across the pubs in industry is 100 -130 seconds, and we also recommend a refresh time of no less than 30 seconds, as it blocks a lot of demand partners and is not very good for user experience.",
