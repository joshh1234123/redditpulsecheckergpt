If so, prioritize the metrics directly linked to that goal—like ROI, CPA, and the number of conversions. I know you’re working on the upper part of the purchase funnel, but consider this: even if your CTR, VCR, or brand awareness lift are high, will that necessarily translate into increased sales?**\n\n\n\n**As secondary metrics, I’d look at those available in Google Analytics 4. I’d pay attention to: number of engaged sessions, bounce rate, number of users in the last 30 days who visited product pages, and average time spent on those pages. These secondary indicators can tell you whether you’re attracting high-quality traffic and reaching the right audience.**",

This is exactly why different models for marketing were born - sales funnel, customer journey, infinity loop etc. \n\nYou don’t start with a question of what the objective is. \nYou start with a question of the growth BARRIER is! \nWhy are people NOT buying right now? \n\nThe answer to this may be as simple as: „they don’t know we exist”, so your marketing goal becomes Awareness (measured by brand lift, or tracking) and your media goal may be things like Reach, Attention etc. In terms of tactics - short form content is probably enough - display, ooh, short unskippable video.\n\nThe answer may be different. Perhaps your potential buyers know you, but so no reason you’re any better vs alternatives. You need to build superiority. You need to do some explaining, need longer contact time. Maybe you need to get the to your website (and optimise for CpNBV), but maybe you just them to see full 30” of your story (completed video views). Or maybe you do some partnerships, PR or whatever - depends on category.\n\nIf your ever come across a company, which tells your their primary objective is NOT sales, you’re talking to a charity, state or some NGO with a cause.",

I mean, you can take that as some sort of awareness indication and it probably wouldn't be wrong in many cases. But here, the goal is pure awareness, meaning to get a certain message into people's heads. In this case, I don't care about any traffic as long as my message is anchoring correctly.",

      "body": "I agree with you when you say that sales is the business objective for almost all enterprises. Our opinions diverge on which metrics we need to consider at the different stages of the purchase funnel and the related bidding strategies.\n\nI find myself in strong agreement with the content of this [**article**](https://getrecast.com/vanity-metrics/), and I really suggest you take a look at it. In the article, there are two examples of campaigns; titled “CTR vs CAC” and “Traffic vs Conversions” ; where, even though the efforts were focused on the upper part of the purchase funnel, the metrics that accurately reflected performance were Cost per Acquired Client and Cost per Conversion.\n\nOf course, different purchase funnel stages mean different target audiences, different creatives, and perhaps different custom bidding strategies; however, as usual, the actionable metrics; those that show whether we are targeting users likely to purchase our services or products; are the ones that truly matter, not vanity metrics.\n\nTo quote the article: **'Any metric that doesn’t have a strong link with sales outcomes is a vanity metric**' and again: **'An actionable metric isn’t just correlated with meaningful business results, it drives them**' Remember, as Peter Drucker says, **'What you measure grows!**’.",

      "body": "Well, if you and your clients are happy with this!... The agencies I worked with gave me feedback that they and their clients are not particularly interested in maximizing reach. An advertising message can be recalled by users because it's appealing, but that doesn't mean it convinces them to buy the product. So, in my opinion, engagement—especially during times of economic crisis—is important. Nowadays, clients want to know the impact of their investments, so they are highly interested in measurements.",

      "body": "Appreciate ther answer.  \nThis is misleading though IMHO. Let me explain my POV.  \nFirst of all - first touch is garbage (just as practically \"any touch\" TBH). Multi-touch is only marginally better - still severely limited to digital-only ecosystems - where ALL your messaging and ALL your client interactions and ALL your sales happen online (practically never true).  \nEngagement? Not sure what you mean here, so let's leave it aside. This can potentially be a good directional indicator in some cases.  \nSales over longer time horizons... I mean... yeah, but the problem we are trying to solve with measurement is a RELATIONSHIP (preferably causation, not mere correlation) between advertising activity and \\[some\\] effect. MMM is the most robust method for building that relationship, but is infrequent, quite complicated and (often) cost prohibitive.\n\nMany discussions here (or other places) seem to ignore that most of advertising budgets come from brands with SIGNIFICANT portion of activity AND sales happening offline. These brands look for upper-funnel measurement for a reason. Brand lift may be flawed for many reasons but is an absolutely valid way to assess if you achieved something more with your advertising vs \"good VCR\".",
