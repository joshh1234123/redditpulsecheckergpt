      "body": "I worked at Google as a DV360 Programmatic Account Manager for 2 years and 6 months. I have run several audio campaigns in DV360 in Italy. Most audio inventories can be bought through preferred deals or programmatic guarantee deals. The main audio inventory sources that come to my mind at this moment are Spotify, YouTube Music, podcasts, Radio 105, and several other inventory sources that I cannot recall right now. To get the complete list, you would need to check the DV360 Marketplace. I wouldn't suggest serving just audio ads; it would be better to combine audio ads with other creative formats. Thus, you can have one campaign in DV360 with different insertion orders and related line items serving on various inventory sources and a combination of creative formats. In this way you will maximize the benefit of using audio creatives in terms of brand awareness and consideration.",
