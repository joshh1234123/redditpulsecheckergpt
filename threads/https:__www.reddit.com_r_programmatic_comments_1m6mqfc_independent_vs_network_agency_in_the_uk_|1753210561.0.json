      "body": "I started out at a global agency and did 7 years there.  A couple more years at global agencies after that and finally been with an indie now for 2 years, and loving it. So for me I would stay with indie for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn your case it does sound like you have reached your cap at your current agency and it's up to them to either find room for you to grow to develop. That's one thing that you do get at network agencies is the opportunity to move into more senior or management roles and build experience until a client scoops you up and then you are basically set for life. And yes, money talks haha. Good luck",

      "body": "I transitioned from a large network agency (Omnicom) to an independent agency. The big network agency was a much easier job, as I was working on one account, purely on activation, planning, and measurement. However, I got cold feet and did get a little bored. My job at the indie agency is MUCH harder. I'm involved in a lot more; however, I've learnt so much, and it does keep my brain ticking. I also felt like a more valued member of the team, rather than just a number. It depends on what you want and where you're at in your career, really!",

      "body": "With a job in global network, you can definitely climb the career ladder a lot faster, I've seen that theres a definitive path there to get to Director level, but some indie agencies are great opportunities too. Indie agency experience can vary a lot from company to company, but global networks can be broadly the same. I've only heard bad things about Zenith and Assembly. \n\nI previously worked at Kinesso and it was good! They've got some good people there for sure.",
