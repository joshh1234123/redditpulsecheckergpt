      "body": "I may be biased, as I do work for an adtech co, but I have pub experience and have hired multiple people from the pub side. \nI think the DSP role is the way to go. Publisher side can be limiting, and if that is the only experience on your cv, it could limit your mobility. That said, don’t just jump at any dsp job- vet the company, team, culture, opportunity… but if it seems intriguing, I‘d go for it!",

      "body": "Just a suggestion: If you switch to Yield, you’ll be in demand for any pricing roles, including client side. The principles are  the same, just different tools, KPIs, and whatnot.\n\nAd Ops in itself is limiting whether publisher, DSP, agency, or client side. \n\nSo I’d approach it as what role do you like, still can leverage some if not all your skills, and is transferable across the industry?\n\nIf the DSP isn’t TTD or the walled gardens, I would be very wary or have an exit strategy. Look at the Microsoft case study after they got rid of Xandr. AI + DSP + Ad Server integrated into one platform, that’s where the future is going for DSPs",

      "body": "Thanks for the reply! The DSP does happen to fall within what you specified and the Publisher I’d be leaving is one of the major ones.\n\nDo you think being on a programmatic trading team would make it easier to shift to Yield? The role seems pretty data intensive than what I’m currently doing but curious to see what you think",

      "body": "The DSP you mentioned has great culture and had colleagues mentioned great vertical and lateral mobility within reason! I’ve seen people at this DSP transition to client side and executive roles at agency, along side moving laterally.\n\nI don’t think you can go wrong based on what you mentioned. I believe you’ll have a lucrative career either way based on those big names you mentioned.\n\nFor your question in a vacuum, programmatic on the buy side can lead to a yield role, but it’s easier to transition to yield on the sell side. Yield was just a suggestion on my part but don’t let that sway you. \n\nAgain, it’s based on what you would like to do. Do you want to help out clients reach their goals relative to their budget? Or do you want to help improve products? Or do you like something else altogether?\n\nResearch what you want to do based on your skills, personality, skills that you want to gain to future proof yourself, and what you want to do in the future. Plug that into ChatGPT, Gemini, and maybe a third AI source since they’re plugged into different data sets. If you have a work instance of AI, you can use that too, theoretically should have access to B2B data sets. Ask for exit strategies, potential for saturation or offshoring, AGI resistance, ask it to label speculation, forecasting, etc. to help validate the probability of likelihood of the prompt.",
