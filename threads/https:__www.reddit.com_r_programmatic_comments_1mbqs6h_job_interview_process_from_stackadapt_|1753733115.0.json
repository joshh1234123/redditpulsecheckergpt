Different roles but always had the same feeling that something was off. \n\nIt’s like they demand that you have your interviewing technique down to the detail and even in early stages the “conversation” should be at 100%. I get that it’s to get rid of the lower level but I interview a lot based on my role and they certainly stood out to me as a little entitled.\n\nMy recommendation would be to follow the STAR method. It worked the second time I interviewed.",

The company is quite focused on innovation so they will pretty much like to have a clear idea of how you think and your skills to turn this into clear actionable next steps.",
