We all put up with shit early in our careers and clearly you’re thinking critically before jumping. Thinking “are the debt payments more than I’ll be able to handle for X amount of time”. A toxic environment with no long term growth and a pay increase that might not advance your career and comes with a strong chance of needing a new position in a year is not worth a short term salary increase. \n\nShort term certainty with medium / long term uncertainty will CERTAINLY bite you in the ass",
