DV360 only exists for YT via sequential campaign types.\n\nThe rest do not, partly because of certain ad policies on both the DSP/SSP side and 3rd/4th party calls in ad tags not being as compliant. DMPs also used to do this at scale using 3p cookies cross-channel but that is pretty much dead now.\n\nMeta / Social cannot do it outside of sequential frequency based campaigns or video based ads.",

Doing it for just an “ad exposure” audience like u/huskyinfantry mentioned is probably not the best. The only exception I’ve found here would be via CTV ad exposure (IP ) and retarget users at the household level. Still though, unless you have surplus budget, going after an exposed audience may not be worthwhile unless you add additional logic. Just because someone was shown an ad, doesn’t mean they’re likely to do anything else.",

No publisher would allow this to happen… or if they found out they might turn off the SSP or DSP, and I doubt any SSP or DSP would risk that.",
