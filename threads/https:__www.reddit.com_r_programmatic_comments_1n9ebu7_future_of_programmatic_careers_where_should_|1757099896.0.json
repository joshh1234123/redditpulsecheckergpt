      "body": "What I can tell you from my experience (8 years in the industry, buy side - agency side + freelance):\n\nLearn at least 1 to 2 years of HANDS ON keyboard campaign management, get to know the platforms, the ecosystem, the measurement and upper funnel best practices. Go deep in that practice. Agency side is a great starting point for that. People tend to overlook hands-on experience, but it will help you in the long run as it shows when someone never piloted a campaign, nor ever step foot in a DSP environment. \n\n Then I suggest pivoting to a more client-facing programmatic media strategy / media planning role if that's interesting to you. The combination of both hands-on experience + strategy will serve you well to ramp up and build your career, whether its DSP/adtech, client or agency side. I made the switch from agency to freelance and that mix is working great for me, 5 years in now. \n\nHope that helps!",

      "body": "Programmatic as a vertical seems to be taking a foothold in top of funnel channels like CTV and streaming audio, due to the measurement you can get there vs. the same channels in linear and traditional. I avoid Google because I’m not impress by their impressions delivery methods (seems scammy and actually just got sued by the EU for it), but I do like TTD and StackAdapt as agnostic partners. Prime and Disney are walled gardens where you can find a large audience, so I’d recommend learning those DSPs as well.",

      "body": "If I were starting out today, I’d focus on CTV and retail media since that’s where more spend is moving, but I’d also master at least one major DSP. Automation and AI will keep reducing the need for manual setup, so if you can connect data, strategy, and business goals, not just push buttons, you'll stay in the game.  \n  \nAs for career path, agencies give you variety and scale, while vendors and ad tech roles give you depth. Both can open global opportunities if you stick with it. The most important thing there is building skills that aren’t tied to a single platform — targeting logic, auction mechanics, and measurement. ",
