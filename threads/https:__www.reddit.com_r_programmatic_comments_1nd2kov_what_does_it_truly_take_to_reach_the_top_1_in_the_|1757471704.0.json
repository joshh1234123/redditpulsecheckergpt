You’ll probably find out that you outgrow them and will find other people to learn from.\n\nBy learn from them it could be following and engaging with their posts on LinkedIn, emailing them with smart questions you are honestly curious to learn (the honest curiosity part matters - experts get bombarded with veiled marketing and generic networking pitches all of the time).\n\nI follow Robert Webster from TAU on LinkedIn and have met him a couple of times in person. If you want to see a cutting edge industry thought leader sharing his ideas, it’s not a bad start.\n\nAlso, working for an agency that gives you the chance to go deep with a variety of significant clients will help you learn a broader view of the industry more quickly than working with a signal one.\n\nAlso, soft skills…. nobody wants to spend discretionary time to talk with someone they don’t vibe with, so learning people and being an effective and empathetic communicator will help make the above happen.",
