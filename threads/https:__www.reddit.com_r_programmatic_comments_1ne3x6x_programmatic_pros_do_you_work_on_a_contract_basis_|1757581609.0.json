I know this applies everywhere but I kind of felt surprised in a programmatic role, it felt a bit easier.",

The relationship was already there so it was a no brainer to higher them. \n\nI’ve seen a lot of times they’ll outsource to companies in India instead of a freelancer since they can handle the large volume of requests.",

If it’s long term and they give you enough time to learn there activation process and that’s great. No matter how long your in the industry everyone has a different process and some agencies have so many specific things they need done by the time you learn them your contract may be up. Long story short make sure they understand what they are hiring you for and the team you interview with has specific tasks they know they are going to utilize you for.",
