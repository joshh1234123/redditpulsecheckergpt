These are not Prime Video directly but other ctv content accessed through Prime, like FanDual Sports Network\n\nThe last one is an audience targeted PMP focused on Prime Subscribers but not on Prime",

      "body": "This isn’t exactly correct\n\nAPD First Access | Prime Video Channels Sports | FDSN | Private Auction Deal - APDFA is inventory secured through distribution deals via FireTV / Prime Video Channels - this particular deal is FanDuel Sports network. FWIW APDFA is reserved inventory so it’s unique, but not Prime Video inventory.\n\nAPD Select_US_Streaming TV_Prime Video Channels - this is prime video channels inventory\n\nAUD-066600-Amazon-MB-CTV-AMZPrimeMemCustomer-US - I don’t know what this is but see its source is Magnite Streaming so I don’t think it’s prime. \n\nI’d suggest filtering to “Prime Video ads” in source to seek Prime Video deals. Also ping me if you have a question and I’ll try to help!",

About 192 streaming services.\n\nThe AUD line is for AUDiences.  Magnite and others have curated audiences available on the Amazon DSP.  From the line info it seems pretty clear that this is an audience that targets Amazon Prime Subscribers but not necessarily Amazon Prime Video viewers.",
