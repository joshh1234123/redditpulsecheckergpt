      "body": "Reach out to any of these: Hivestack, Vistar, or PlaceExchange. Specify what you're looking for, and they'll send back detailed information.\n\nwhat to include in your request:\n\n1. Your target location/geo\n2. Ask what type of inventories are available in your target geo\n3. Request a visual map link of the targeting plan, where you can see actual location of the screens, publisher names, etc.\n\nNext steps:\n\nSelect the screens (/publishers) you want to target according to the client's needs. Set budget, flight dates, and ask the SSP vendor to create a PMP with those screens.\n\nAdd and activate the PMP in your dooh campaign in the DSP.\n\nMonitor spending and ask the SSP to help with creative approval from publishers if the process is taking too long.\n\nOnce the campaign is running, request mockup pictures from the SSP to show your client. They'll work with the publishers to get these.\n\nGood Luck!",
