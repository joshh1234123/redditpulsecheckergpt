      "body": "I used to product manage software to support a programmatic ATD.\n\nYMMV between agencies, but at my agency, it usually is a % of the overall budget.  Meaning, if I have $100, and the % is 10%, then $90 is for media, $10 is what the agency pockets.  $90 is all-inclusive media budget (what you’d enter in the DSP).  Platform and data fees were included, so it’s passed on.\n\nThe above example is for a transparent client.  Agencies operate with transparent and opaque cost models, so it’s hard to say how an opaque cost model will handle the fees.  Our opaque models did not pass along fees, meaning if I inputted $90 in a DSP, inventory costs would equal $90, total media costs would equal $90 + platform fee + data.  The gotcha is that in an opaque models did, the margin is way, way higher.",

So if media includes programmatic or social, or anything, they don’t charge any additional markups. If all in the client knows they’re going to spend 2M in media costs over a 12 month period and know they’re going to pay an agency 1.2M(labor includes media management, creative hours, brand and strategy hours, account management, project management, etc…) over that 12 months of service then they know they’re not paying more than 3.2M in that year, regardless of what media is ran.",

If you have an auditor or top tier consultancy that ran your pitch, you can get those figures before appointment, otherwise they are usually undisclosed (can be buried in an invoice though).

I think that this is fine, whether the client is disclosed or not.\n\nWhat is wrong is when a client gives $90, with a $5 CPA goal, and I manage to drive so many conversions that a $5 CPA only costs me $30.
