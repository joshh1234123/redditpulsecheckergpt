If you actually want results from your campaigns, and to be able to measure those results, stick to a tier 1 DSP.",

The tradeoff is it can be more complex to manage and not always the most transparent with fees. StackAdapt is lighter, more user friendly and strong on things like native and audience targeting, but the scale isnt quite the same as DV360..\n\nIf you ever plan to add TV or CTV into your programmatic mix, you could also try checking on Tatari since theyre set up specifically for buying and measuring campaigns on linear and streaming TV..",

      "body": "Stackadapt is great if you don't have the money to reach the minimums DV360 or one of their resellers need. It's also useful in niche scenarios(like marijuana campaigns) where google's restrictions won't let you run.\n\nTheir page context AI feature is cool - better than the keyword targeting on Google, and their team will build cool creatives for you if you spend enough. They'll even run campaigns for you if you're over something like $30K/quarter, so if your team is lean and needs some extra support, that's awesome.\n\n  \nThe major drawbacks are that you don't know how much your fees actually are(your AM won't even know this unless they know how to decipher some numbers on the back end-  but they don't receive that training), and they basically lie to you about what you're paying for (Ie - telling you all the data is free, when they're really just lumping the media and data costs together).\n\n  \nIf you're running your own ads and don't have enough money to go DV360, then Stackadapt can be useful - especially if you get into that range where they're running your campaigns for you, and your company doesn't need to hire people to do it.\n\nIf you've got the money to go with DV360, odds are your performance will be better. If your agency is using Stackadapt over DV360/Amazon/TTD, then you should be worried, because you're paying whatever your agency's markup is + stack's markup, which can be even higher than your agency's... and the agency might just be passing off the work to stack anyways, and just taking the cut.",
