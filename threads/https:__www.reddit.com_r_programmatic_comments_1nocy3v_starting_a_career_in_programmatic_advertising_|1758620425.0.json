      "body": "In Australia, almost all the big hold cos and even some of the tech firms are currently looking for traders. Your experience on other platforms means you won't be starting from scratch either. I'd recommend the DV360 and TTD training modules for the CV and to understand the lingo, but I'd recommend being confident about applying for more experienced roles.",

If you don’t know programmatic, I think a lot of hiring managers/business owners are starting to place much more value in programmatic over other channels, and I think skillsets/opportunities in social, SEO, and other areas are probably going to start drying up quickly, despite the fact that if the ai is dialed in really well, programmatic could easily be automated. \n\nEither way, if you know programmatic or another platform the only way to create job security is by knowing how to implement and execute an omnichannel campaign on your own.",

Primarily would say being comfortable with these: DSP, SSP, Adserver, Ad Verification, PMP, PG.\n\nAlso the channel mix, so not just thinking Programmatic = Display banners but more around the other mediums that exist, from standard Video / Mobile App to more emerging CTV / DOOH / Audio / Commerce.\n\nWould also recommend signing up for Digiday / Adexchanger newsletters which is always good for industry news.",

      "body": "Despite the worsening job market, it is still really tough to fill programmatic roles. Being able to speak to how programmatic fits into the larger media structure is a great skill. You probably won’t get a programmatic role looking for 10 years experience, but there are plenty of roles looking for 2-3 years experience that will pivot to someone with experience in an adjacent field.\n\nIf you have the flexibility or desire to do so, living near a big programmatic media hub helps a lot too. Despite the fact that programmatic is an automated method of buying that largely involves staring at Excel and a DSP (two computer based programs), employers are fucking stupid and prefer people to drag their ass to an office to stare at a screen all day in an office environment instead of staring at the same screen, doing the same tasks, in a home environment.",

      "body": "I’ve seen a lot of people move into programmatic as a career switch in their 30s. Have had people who used to be accountants or work in finance make the switch. This was back when I worked at two different big holdcos. I’d probably say trying to find an agency programmatic role would be a good starting point. Your experience would be transferable so you wouldn’t really be starting at some entry level role.",

      "body": "I built up a programmatic team from scratch in my early thirties, without any prior knowledge. Most of what I learned was self-taught, with only limited support from another agency.\n\nMy advice: take the time to understand the details of programmatic early on. Focus on the basics — and really make sure you understand them deeply. For example:\n\n* How does a programmatic auction work?\n* How does an ad server function?\n* How does bidding actually work?\n* What exactly do a DSP and an SSP do?\n* What is header bidding?\n* What happens step by step in a programmatic auction?\n* How does cookie syncing work?\n\nThese are just a few key examples. Building a solid understanding of these fundamentals early will give you a huge long-term advantage.\n\nGood luck — you can do it!",
