      "body": "I love Walmart DSP. Been activating on it since early 2024. Incrementality can be measured using sales lift studies that can be activated if the advertiser spends a minimum of $150k.\n\nIt looks like the trade desk because they partnered with them to be able to serve ads across their supply inventory. The best insights are within Walmart connect's reporting dashboard. Spend lags in Walmart DSP reporting compared to TTD. \n\nTTD UI shows 14 day attribution while you can see 30 day attribution in Walmart connect or by exporting sales reports through Walmart DSP (TTD UI reporting tab)\n\nWalmart recently sunset their managed service offering so I don't think you will run into those problems as much moving forward",

      "body": "Yes, similar thoughts. Overall we're pretty happy with it. I believe Walmart sort of batches sales data and then sends that to TTD so conversion data can be delayed by a few days. \n\nWe use the same platform for reporting that we use for our other DSP's, they have a beta connector that works fairly well although has limitations which we are told is caused on Walmart's end and I believe them (ie no creative reporting).\n\nIf it's something that we can't pull into the reporting platform, that can be interesting but we're transparent with the clients. We tell them that data we report on manually is generally delayed by \\~5 days due to the conversions,. and then there may be small discrepancies in different sections as some data is only available in TTD and some is only available in Walmart UI and they are not synced timing-wise.",
